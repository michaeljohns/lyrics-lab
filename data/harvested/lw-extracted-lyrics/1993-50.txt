Twenty-five years and my life is still. Trying to get up that great big hill of hope. For a destination. I realized quickly when I knew I should. That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man. For whatever that means. And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed. Just to get it all out what's in my head. And I, I am feeling a little peculiar. And so I wake in the morning and I step outside. And I take a deep breath and I get real high. And I scream at the top of my lungs:. "What's going on?". And I say, hey-ey-ey. Hey-ey-ey. I said: "Hey, what's going on?". And I say, hey-ey-ey. Hey-ey-ey. I said: "Hey, what's going on?". And I try. Oh my god, do I try. I try all the time. In this institution. And I pray. Oh my god, do I pray. I pray every single day. For a revolution. And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed. Just to get it all out what's in my head. And I, I am feeling a little peculiar. And so I wake in the morning and I step outside. And I take a deep breath and I get real high. And I scream at the top of my lungs:. "What's going on?". And I say, hey-ey-ey. Hey-ey-ey. I said: "Hey, what's going on?". And I say, hey-ey-ey. Hey-ey-ey. I said: "Hey, what's going on?". And I say, hey-ey-ey. Hey-ey-ey. I said: "Hey, what's going on?". And I say, hey-ey-ey. Hey-ey, yeah yeah yeah. I said: "Hey, what's going on?". Twenty-five years and my life is still. Trying to get up that great big hill of hope. For a destination.
