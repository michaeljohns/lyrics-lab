Saturday night I was downtown. Working for the FBI. Sitting in a nest of bad men. Whiskey bottles piling high. Bootlegging boozer on the west side. Full of people who are doing wrong. Just about to call up the DA man. When I heard this woman singing a song. A pair of 45's made me open my eyes. My temperature started to rise. She was a long cool woman in a black dress. Just a 5'9" beautiful tall. With just one look I was a bad mess. 'Cause that long cool woman had it all. Woo! I saw her head up to the table. With a tall walking big black cat. Well, Charlie said "I hope that you're able, boy. 'Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at". When suddenly we heard the sirens. And everybody started to run. I jumped down and across the table. When I heard somebody shooting a gun. Well, the DA was pumping my left hand. And then she was a-holding my right. Well, I told her "Don't get scared. 'Cause you're gonna be spared". Well I've gotta be forgiven. If I wanna spend my living. With a long cool woman in a black dress. Just a 5'9" beautiful tall. Well, with just one look I was a bad mess. 'Cause that long cool woman had it all. Had it all, had it all. Had it all, had it all. Had it all, had it all.
