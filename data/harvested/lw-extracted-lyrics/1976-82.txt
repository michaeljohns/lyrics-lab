We've been together since way back when. Sometimes I never want to see you again. But I want you to know, after all these years. You're still the one I want whisperin' in my ear. You're still the one I want to talk to in bed. Still the one that turns my head. We're still having fun and you're still the one. I looked at your face every day. But I never saw it till I went away. When winter came, I just wanted to go. Deep in the desert, I longed for the snow. You're still the one that makes me laugh. Still the one that's my better half. We're still having fun and you're still the one. You're still the one that makes me strong. Still the one I want to take along. We're still having fun and you're still the one, yes you are. Changing, our love, it comes and goes. Even though we grow, it grows too. You're still the one that I love to touch. Still the one and I can't get enough. We're still having fun and you're still the one. You're still the one who can scratch my itch. (You're) Still the one that I wouldn't switch. We're still having fun and you're still the one. You are still the one that makes me shout. Still the one that I dream about. We're still having fun and you're still the one. You are still the one. Yeah, still the one. We're still having fun and you're still the one.
