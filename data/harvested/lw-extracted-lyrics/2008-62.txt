[Rihanna]. That's how much I love you. That's how much I need you. And I can't stand you. Must everything you do make me wanna smile. Can I not like you for awhile? (No.). [Ne-Yo]. But you wont let me. You upset me girl. And then you kiss my lips. All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset). Can't remember what you did. [Rihanna]. But I hate it. You know exactly what to do. So that I can't stay mad at you. For too long that's wrong. [Ne-Yo]. But I hate it. You know exactly how to touch. So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more. Said I despise that I adore you. [Rihanna]. And I hate how much I love you boy (yeah.). I can't stand how much I need you (I need you.). And I hate how much I love you boy (oooh whoa.). But I just can't let you go. And I hate that I love you so (oooh.). [Ne-Yo]. You completely know the power that you have. the only one that makes me laugh. [Rihanna]. Said and it's not fair. How you take advantage of the fact. That I. love you beyond a reason why. And it just ain't right. [Ne-Yo]. And I hate how much I love you girl. I can't stand how much I need you (yeah.). And I hate how much I love you girl. But I just can't let you go. But I hate that I love you so. [Both]. One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me. And your kiss won't make me weak. But no one in this world knows me the way you know me. So you'll probably always have a spell on me. [Ne-Yo]. Yeaahhh. oohh. [Rihanna]. That's how much I love you (how much I need you). That's how much I need you (how much I love you). That's how much I love you (oh, need you). That's how much I need you. And I hate that I love you soooo. And I hate how much I love you boy. I can't stand how much I need ya (can't stand how much I need you). And I hate how much I love you boy. But I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go no.). And I hate that I love you so. [Both]. And I hate that I love you so. soo.
