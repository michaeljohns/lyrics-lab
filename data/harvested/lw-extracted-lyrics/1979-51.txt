When the lights go down in the California town, People are in for the evening. I jump into my car and I throw in my guitar, My heartbeat in time with my breathing. Driving over Canaan, singing to my soul, There's people out there turning music into gold. Ah, my buddy Jim Bass, he's a-working pumping gas, And he makes two-fifty for an hour. He's got rhythm in his hands as he's tapping on the cans, Sings rock and roll in the shower. Driving over Canaan, singing to his soul, There's people out there turning music into gold. Ah, California girls are the greatest in the world, Each one a song in the making. Singing right to me, I can hear the melody, Story is there for the taking. Driving over Canaan, singing to my soul, There's people out there turning music into gold. (Ooh). Driving over Canaan, singing to my soul, There's people out there turning music into gold. When the lights go down in the California town, People are in for the evening. I jump into my car and I throw in my guitar, My heartbeat in time with my breathing. Driving over Canaan, singing to my soul. There's people out there turning music into gold. Flying over Canaan, singing to my soul, People out there turning music into gold. People out there turning music into gold. People out there turning music into gold. (Ooh, yeah). People out there turning music into gold (into gold). People out there turning music into gold (into gold). People out there turning music into gold (into gold). (Yes, babe). People out there turning music into gold (into gold). People out there turning music into gold (into gold). Slipping down the back road. People out there turning music into gold (into gold). People out there turning music into gold (into gold).
