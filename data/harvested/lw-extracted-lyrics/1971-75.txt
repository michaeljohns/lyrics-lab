Funky nassau. The Beginning of the End. Nassau's gone funky and Nassau's gone soul. We've got a doggone beat now. We're gonna call our very own Mini skirts, maxi skirts and Afro hair do. People are doin' their won. Don't care 'bout you and me. Naussau rock and Nassau roll. Nassau's got a whole lot of soul. Listen to the drummer strum in his feet. New York they say has got a whole lot of soul. London town is too doggone cold. Nassau's got sunshine and this you all know. But we've gone funky. And got some soul too. Funky Nassau funky.
