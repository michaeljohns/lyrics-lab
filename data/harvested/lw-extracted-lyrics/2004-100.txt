Jack and Diane painted a picture of my life and my dreams. Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me. Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along. 'Cause every time I hear that song. I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy. Driving my first love out to the levee. Livin' life with no sense of time. I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line. A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine. Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks. Every time I hear that song, I go back. I go back. Well, I used to rock all night long. To Keep On Rocking Me, Baby. At frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies. Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along. 'Cause everytime I hear that song. I go back to the smell of an old gym floor. The taste of salt on a Carolina shore. After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends. I go back to watchin' summer fade to fall. Growin' up too fast and I do recall. Wishing time would stop right in it's tracks. Everytime I hear that song, I go back. I go back. We all have a song that's somehow stamped our lives. That takes us to another place and time. So, I go back to a pew, preacher and a choir. Singin' 'bout God and brimstone and fire. And the smell of Sunday chicken after church. I go back to the loss of a real good friend. And the sixteen summers I shared with him. Now, Only The Good Die Young stops me in my tracks. Everytime I hear that song, I go back. I go back. To the feel of a fifty yard line. A blanket, a girls, and some raspberry wine. I go back. To watching summer fade to fall. Growing up too fast and I do recall. I go back. To the loss of a real good friend. And the sixteen summers I shared with him. I go back. I go back.
