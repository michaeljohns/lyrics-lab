. I was lying on the grass of Sunday morning of last week. Indulging in my self-defeat. My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat. A comfortable three feet deep. Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week. Impaired my tribal lunar-speak. And of course you can't become if you only say what you would've done. So I missed a million miles of fun. I know it's up for me. (If you steal my sunshine). Making sure I'm not in too deep. (If you steal my sunshine). Keeping versed and on my feet. (If you steal my sunshine). I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street. L-A-T-E-R that week. My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats. An incredible eight foot heap. Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tear in a staring under heat. Involved an under usual feat. And I'm not only among but I invite you all to come. So I missed a million miles of fun. I know it's up for me. (If you steal my sunshine). Making sure I'm not in too deep. (If you steal my sunshine). Keeping versed and on my feet. (If you steal my sunshine). I know it's done for me. (If you steal my sunshine). Not as some and hard to see. (If you steal my sunshine). Keeping dumb and built to beat. (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine).
