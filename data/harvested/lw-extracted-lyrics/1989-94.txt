If you want it, you can have it, that's what you say. But I don't want the things that you leave behind. Take the pictures, take the windows and the walls. Baby, won't you leave me my peace of mind. Oh, such a waste of time. Oh, such a waste. I still want you, baby. (Heaven help me). Heaven help me. (Talk to strangers). Talk to strangers. (Heaven help me over you). Help me over you. (I can't seem to take these changes). Everything reminds my heart of you. Thought the first time was the last time. Would be forever. Now I find I'm having to search again. It'll happen, it's gotta happen, come together. I just wish somebody would tell me when. Oh, such a waste of time. Oh, such a waste. I still want you baby. (Heaven help me). Heaven help me. (Talk to strangers). Talk to strangers. (Heaven help me over you). Help me over you. (I can't seem to take these changes). Everything reminds my heart of you. Heaven help, heaven help. Heaven, heaven. Heaven help me. Heaven help, heaven help. Heaven, heaven. Heaven help me. (Heaven help me). Heaven help me. (Talk to strangers). Talk to strangers. (Heaven help me over you). Help me over you. (I can't seem to take these changes). Everything reminds my heart of you. (Heaven help me). Heaven help me. (Talk to strangers). Talk to strangers. (Heaven help me over you). Help me over you. (I can't seem to take these changes). Everything reminds my heart of you. Heaven help, heaven help. Heaven, heaven. Heaven help me. Heaven help, heaven help. Heaven, heaven. Heaven help me. Heaven help, heaven help. Heaven, heaven. Heaven help me. Heaven help, heaven help. Heaven, heaven. Heaven help me. You're someone else's baby. So sad without you darling. The gods of love can't help me now. Heaven help, heaven help. Heaven, heaven. Heaven help me. Heaven help, heaven help. Heaven, heaven. Heaven help me.
