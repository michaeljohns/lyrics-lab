A little ditty about Jack and Diane. Two American kids growin' up in the heartland. Jackie gonna be a football star. Diane's a debutante, backseat of Jackie's car. Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee-Freez. Diane's sittin' on Jackie's lap. He's got his hands between her knees. Jackie say, "Hey Diane, let's run off behind the shady trees. Dribble off those Bobbie Brooks, let me do what I please.". And say uh. Oh yeah, life goes on. Long after the thrill of livin' is gone, they say uh. Oh yeah, life goes on. Long after the thrill of livin' is gone, they walk on. Jackie sits back, collects his thoughts for the moment. Scratches his head and does his best James Dean. "Well then there Diane, we oughta run off to the city.". Diane says, "Baby, you ain't missin' nothing.". And Jackie say uh. Oh yeah, life goes on. Long after the thrill of livin' is gone. Oh yeah, they say life goes on. Long after the thrill of livin' is gone. Gonna let it rock. Let it roll. Let the Bible Belt come and save my soul. Hold on to sixteen as long as you can. Changes come around real soon. Make us women and men. Oh yeah, life goes on. Long after the thrill of livin' is gone. Oh yeah, they say life goes on. Long after the thrill of livin' is gone. A little ditty about Jack and Diane. Two American kids doin' the best they can.
