Are you ready boy? Here I come, catch me I'm falling. You came into my life. The look in your eyes. Took me by surprise. It's you. And nobody else. Your love hase made me. So blind I can't see. I am descending. From heaven above. So catch me I'm fallin baby. Hold onto my love. (Chorus). Catch me I'm falling. Catch me now I'm falling. Catch me I'm falling. Catch me now I'm falling. Falling in love. Two hearts beating in time. The rhythm as one. I am yours, you are mine. For you. I surrender myself. Each night-every day. Always feeling this way. Falling in motion. As though I had wings. Your sweet love and devotion. Baby it's magic. A magical thing. Chorus. (Tag). Ooooh baby, what can I do? I'm falling for you.
