LA's fine, sunshine most of the time. The feeling is laid back. Palm trees grow and the rents are low. But you know I keep thinking about. Making my way back. Well, I'm New York City born and raised. But nowadays, I'm lost between two shores. LA's fine, but it ain't home. New York's home but it ain't mine no more. I am, I said. To no one there. And no one heard at all. Not even the chair. I am, I cried. I am, said I. And I am lost, and I can't even say why. Leavin' me lonely still. Did you ever read about a frog who dreamed of being a king. And then became one. Well, except for the names and a few other changes. If you talk about me, the story's the same one. But I got an emptiness deep inside. And I've tried but it won't let me go. And I'm not a man who likes to swear. But I've never cared for the sound of being alone. I am, I said. To no one there. And no one heard at all. Not even the chair. I am, I cried. I am, said I. And I am lost, and I can't even say why. I am, I said. I am, I cried. I am.
