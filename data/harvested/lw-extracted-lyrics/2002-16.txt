Yo, after tonight. [Intro] (2x). Don't leave your girl 'round me. True playa for real. Ask my nigga Pharrell. [Verse 1]. Situations will arise. In our lives. But you gotta be smart about it. Celebrations with the guys. I sacrificed. Cause I knew you could not sleep without it. Meanwhile I. I loved you. You were my girl. You see I. Thought the world of you. But you're still steady leavin' baby. [Chorus] (2x). You don't have to call. It's okay girl. 'Cause I'ma be alright tonight. [Verse 2]. Aw, girl. Your face is saying why. Tears in eyes. Should've been more smart about it. Should've cherished me. Listenin' to friends. Now it's the endin'. Then again, no story can end without it. Damn I. I loved you. You were my girl. You see I. Thought the world of you. But you're still steady leavin' baby. [Chorus] (2x). [Bridge]. Gonna boogie tonight. 'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy. To stay home. Waiting for love. So tonight. I'm gonna do what a single man does. And that's party. (Oh yeahhh. I'm numb). [Chorus] (3x). [Bridge]. Chorus(3x).
