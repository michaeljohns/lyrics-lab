Babyface and L.A. Reid. Last night, I had the time of my life--. it's true. For last night, I made love for the very. first time. With you. I never knew love could be so sweet. It never made a difference to me. But ever since the day that you appeared. I'm telling you made the difference. Now love is so clear. And I can't stop (Can't stop)**. How I feel. I'm diggin on you. You diggin on me. We diggin on we. And Oh I can't stop (Can't Stop). How I feel. I'm diggin on you. You diggin on me. Last night, you bought something special. out of me. And for the first time. You made my dream a reality. I never though love was meant for me. For Iwas blind and could not see. You bought about a love that's so sincere. And I'm telling you, you've made the. difference. Now love is so sincere. Repeat chorus ** 4x. You've got me thinking that I need. protection. Cause your love is so strong. I don't wanna do wrong. Girl your love seems like it's true. protection. You just give me a call. And I'll give you my all. Repeat Chorus.
