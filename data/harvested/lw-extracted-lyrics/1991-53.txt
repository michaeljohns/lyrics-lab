And he fills it only halfway. And before I even argue. He is looking out the window. At somebody coming in. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. "It is always nice to see you". Says the man behind the counter. To the woman who has come in. She is shaking her umbrella. And I look the other way. As they are kissing their hellos. And I'm pretending not to see them. And instead I pour the milk. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. I open up the paper. There's a story of an actor. Who had died while he was drinking. It was no one I had heard of. And I'm turning to the horoscope. And looking for the funnies. When I'm feeling someone watching me. And so I raise my head. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. There's a woman on the outside. Looking inside, does she see me? No, she does not really see me. 'Cause she sees her own reflection. And I'm trying not to notice. That she's hitching up her skirt. And while she's straightening her stockings. Her hair has gotten wet. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Oh, this rain it will continue. Through the morning as I'm listening. To the bells of the cathedral. I am thinking of your voice. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo.
