We didn't care if people stared. We'd make out in a crowd somewhere. Somebody'd tell us to get a room. It's hard to believe that was me and you. Now we keep saying that we're okay. But I don't want to settle for good, not great. I miss the way that it felt back then. I wanna feel that way again. Been so long, bet you forget. The way I used to kiss your neck. Remind me, remind me. So on fire, so in love. Way back when we couldn't get enough. Remind me, remind me. Remember the airport, dropping me off. We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop. And I felt bad 'cause you missed your flight. But that meant we had one more night. Do you remember how it used to be? We'd turn out the lights and we didn't just sleep. Remind me, baby, remind me. Oh, so on fire, so in love. That look in your eyes that I miss so much. Remind me, baby, remind me. I wanna feel that way. Yeah, I wanna hold you close. Oh, if you still love me. Don't just assume I know. Oh baby, remind me. Remind me. Do you remember the way it felt? You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves. Remind me, yeah, remind me. All those things that you used to do. That made me fall in love with you. Remind me, oh baby, remind me. Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt. All those mornings I was late for work. Remind me, oh baby, remind me, yeah. Oh baby, remind me. Baby, remind me, yeah, oh. (Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt). Baby, remind me.
