Girl, well it's been one of those days again. And it seems like the harder I try. Over and over, I'm right back where I began. But you understand, oh girl. When nothing else in this world goes right. Oh, I just want to run to you, You'll pull me through, whoa, baby. Who wouldn't want to have you in their life? Tell me what kind of man would I be? Living a life without any meaning. And I know you could surely survive without me. But if I had to live without you. Tell me what kind of man would I be? Times when it was pointless for me to try. I was more than a desperate man. What seemed like forever. Was gone with one touch of your hand, oh girl. If I could count all the sleepless nights. When you were there for me. A fool could see, whoa, baby. Once that I found you there was no letting go. Tell me what kind of man would I be? Living a life without any meaning. And I know you could surely survive without me. But if I had to live without you. Tell me what kind of man would I be? Tell me what kind of man would I be? Living a life without any meaning. And I know you could surely survive without me. But if I had to live without you. Tell me what kind of man would I be? What kind of man would I be? Living a life without any meaning. And I know you could surely survive without me. But if I had to live without you. Tell me what kind of man. Tell me what kind of man. Tell me what kind of man would I be?. (What kind of man would I be?). Tell me what kind of man would I be? (What kind of man would I be?). Tell me what kind of man.
