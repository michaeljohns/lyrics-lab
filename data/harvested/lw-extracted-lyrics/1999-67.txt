I could stay awake just to hear you breathing. Watch you smile while you are sleeping. While you're far away and dreaming. I could spend my life in this sweet surrender. I could stay lost in this moment forever. Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure. I don't wanna close my eyes. I don't wanna fall asleep. 'Cause I'd miss you. And I don't wanna miss a thing. 'Cause even when I dream of you. The sweetest dream will never do. I'd still miss you. And I don't wanna miss a thing. Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating. And I'm wondering what your dreaming. Wondering if it's me your seeing. And then I kiss your eyes, and thank God we're together. I just wanna stay with you in this moment for all, forever. I don't wanna close my eyes. I don't wanna fall asleep. 'Cause I'd miss you. And I don't wanna miss a thing. 'Cause even when I dream of you. The sweetest dream will never do. I'd still miss you. And I don't wanna miss a thing. I don't wanna miss one smile. I don't wanna miss one kiss. Well, I just wanna be with you, right here with you. Just like this. I just wanna hold you close. Feel your heart so close to mine. And just stay here in this moment. For all the rest of time. I don't wanna close my eyes. I don't wanna fall asleep. 'Cause I'd miss you. And I don't wanna miss a thing. 'Cause even when I dream of you. The sweetest dream will never do. I'd still miss you. And I don't wanna miss a thing. I'd still miss you, baby. I don't wanna close my eyes. I don't wanna fall asleep. 'Cause I'd miss you. And I don't wanna miss a thing. 'Cause even when I dream of you. The sweetest dream will never do. I'd still miss you. And I don't wanna miss a thing.
