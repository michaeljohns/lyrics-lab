There's a light. A certain kind of light. That never shown on me. I want my life to be. Lived with you. Lived with you. There's a way. Everybody says. To do each and every little thing. But what does it bring. If I ain't got you. If I ain't got you. Baby you don't know what its like. Baby you don't know what its like. To love somebody. To love somebody. The way I love you. In my mind. I see your face again. I know my frame of mind. You ain't got to be so blind. But I'm blind. So very blind. I'm a man. Can't you see what I am. I live and breathe and for you. But what good does it do. If I ain't got you. If I ain't got you. Baby you don't know what its like. Baby you don't know what its like. To love somebody. To love somebody. The way I love you.
