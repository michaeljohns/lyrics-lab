I used to go out to parties and stand around. 'Cause I was too nervous to really get down. But my body yearned to be free. I got up on the floor and thought somebody could choose me. No more standing there beside the walls. Finally got myself together, baby, and I'm havin' a ball. As long as you're groovin', there's always a chance. Somebody watchin' might wanna make romance. Move your body, ooh baby, you dance all night. To the groove and feel alright. Everybody's groovin' on like a fool. But if you see me, spread out and let me in. Baby, just party high and low. Let me step into your erotic zone. Move it up, turn it 'round. Ooh, shake it down, ow. You can love me when you want to, babe. This is such a groovy party, baby. We're here face to face. Everybody's swingin'. This is such a groovy place. All the young ladies are so fine. You're movin' your body. Easy with no doubts. I know what you thinkin', baby. You wanna turn me out. I think I'm gonna let you do it, babe. Keep on dancin'. You got to get it. Got to give it up. If you want it, you've got to give it up. If you want it, you've got to give it up. If you want it, you've got to give it up. If you want it, you've got to give it up.
