. My mistake was to love you, girl. Love you, girl. My mistake was to give you all. Tell the world. First I had you. In the palm of my hand. But I let you slip through. Like grains of sand. At the beginning. When I didn't care. Like my own reflection. You were always there. My mistake was to love you, girl. Love you, girl. My mistake was to give you all. Tell the world. You were sweeter. Then my very own skin. But what did I do for you. Not a thing. In front of my friends. You broke me down. Since then darling. It's hard to track you down. My mistake was to love you, boy. Love you, boy. My mistake was to give my all. Tell the world. Many a smile. You put on my face. But I paid dearly. With the tears I taste. My tenderness. Made you cold, not sweet. 'Cause if a girl loves you. You only call her weak. My mistake was to love you, boy. Love you, boy. My mistake was to give my all. Tell the world. My mistake was to love you, girl. Love you, girl. My mistake was to give you all. Tell the world.
