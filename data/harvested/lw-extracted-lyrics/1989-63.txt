Since you been gone. I feel my life slipping away. I look to the sky. And everything is turnin' grey. All I made was one mistake. How much more will I have to pay. Why can't you think it over. Why can't you forget about the past. When love makes this sound baby. A heart needs a second chance. Don't put me down babe. Can't you see I love you. Since you've been gone I've been in a trance. This heart needs a second chance. Don't say it's over I just can't say goodbye. So this is love. Standing in the pouring rain. I fooled on you. But she never meant a thing. And I know I ain't got no right. To ask you to sympathize. But why can't you think it over. Why can't you forget about the past. When love makes this sound baby. A heart needs a second chance. Don't put me down baby. Can't you see I love you. Since you been gone I've been in a trance. This heart needs a second chance. Don't say it's over I just can't say goodbye. I never loved her. I never needed her. She was willing and that's all there is to say. Don't forsake me. Please don't leave me now. A heart needs a second chance. Yeahhhhhh you've been gone and I've been in a trance. This heart needs a second chance. Don't say it's over I just can't say goodbye. Please forgive me and forget it. I was wrong and I admit it. Why can't we talk it over. Why can't we forget about, forget about the past. (A heart needs a second chance). When love makes this sound baby. (A heart needs a second chance). Don't put me down babe. You've been gone I've been in a trance. This heart needs a second chance. Don't say it's over I just can't say goodbye. (A heart needs a second chance). When love makes this sound babe. (A heart needs a second chance). (A heart needs a second chance). When love makes this sound baby. (A heart needs a second chance).
