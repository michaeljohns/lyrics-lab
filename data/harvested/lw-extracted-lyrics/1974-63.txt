If it were easy as fishin'. You could be a musician. If you could make sounds loud or mellow. Get a secondhand guitar. Chances are, you'll go far. If you get in with the right bunch of fellows. People see you having fun. Just a-lying in the sun. Tell them that you like it this way. It's the work that we avoid. And we're all self-employed. We love to work at nothing all day.
