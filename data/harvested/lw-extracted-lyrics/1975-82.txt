Sha la la la-- la la la. Oh baby. Sha la la la-- la la la. Oh baby. I've been gone so long I know what to do. Oh baby. That I know you don't know what I've been going through. Oh baby. 'Cause you make me happy baby, so I can say. Sha la la la-- la la la. I love you. Sha la la la-- la la la. Thinkin' of you. I know you can tell what's on my mind. Oh baby. And I've been feeling this way for such a long time. Ya, baby. Aw, make me happy baby, aw, make me happy, I wanna say. I'm trying, this feeling just won't die. Oh. Sha la la la-- la la la. Make you cry. It's something that just gets down in your bones. Baby. And once I see you I can't leave your love alone. Ya, heh, baby. Aw, make me happy baby, aw, make me happy baby, let me sing. Sha la la la-- la la la. Oh baby. Sha la la la-- la la la. Oh baby.
