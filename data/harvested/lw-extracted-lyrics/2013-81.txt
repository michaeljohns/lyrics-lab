Oh, you’re killing me, you know it ain't fair, yeah. Ride on through the middle of the night. Let the moonlight kiss your skin. When you dance like that, your jeans so tight.

Don’t stop till you thrill me, oh how you thrill me. Always in control, how you do it, I don’t know. But I don’t care, take me anywhere. ‘Cause it’s beautiful, ooh you make me feel undressable.

You’re beautiful, good Lord, you’re fucking beautiful. And I can’t pretend that that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah. Oh oh oh oh. Yeah yeah. You don’t know what you’re doing darling.
