Whoa. A hot summer night fell like a net. I've gotta find my baby yet. I need you to soothe my head. Turn my blue heart to red. Doctor, doctor, gimme the news. I got a bad case of loving you. No pill's gonna cure my ill. I've got a bad case of lovin' you. A pretty face don't make no pretty heart. I learned that, buddy, from the start. You think I'm cute, a little bit shy. Mama, I ain't that kind of guy. Doctor, doctor, gimme the news. I got a bad case of loving you. No pill's gonna cure my ill. I got a bad case of lovin' you. Whoa. I know you like it, you like it on top. Tell me, mama, are you gonna stop? You had me down twenty-one to zip. Smile of Judas on your lip. Shake my fist, knock on wood. I've got it bad and I got it good. Doctor, doctor, gimme the news. I've got a bad case of loving you. No pill's gonna cure my ill. I got a bad case of lovin' you.
