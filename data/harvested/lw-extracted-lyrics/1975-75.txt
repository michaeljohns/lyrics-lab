Hoo, hah. Hah, hoo. Precious moments. When will I see you again? When will we share precious moments? Will I have to wait forever? Will I have to suffer. And cry the whole night through? When will I see you again? When will our hearts beat together? Are we in love or just friends? Is this my beginning or is this the end?. When will I see you again. When will I see you again. When will I see you again. Hah, hoo. Precious moments. Are we in love or just friends? Is this my beginning or is this the end?. When will I see you again? When will I see you again? Sweet sweet love of mine. Come, come. Tell me, yeah. My sweet lover, yeah. Ooh yeah. Come on, come on. Ooh yeah.
