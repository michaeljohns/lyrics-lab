I remember finding out about you. Every day my mind is all around you. Looking out from my lonely room. Day after day. Bring it home, baby, make it soon. I give my love to you. I remember holding you while you sleep. Every day I feel the tears that you weep. Looking out of my lonely gloom. Day after day. Bring it home, baby, make it soon. I give my love to you. Looking out of my lonely room. Day after day. Bring it home, baby, make it soon. I give my love to you. I remember finding out about you. Every day my mind is all around you. Looking out of my lonely gloom. Day after day. Bring it home, baby, make it soon. I give my love to you.
