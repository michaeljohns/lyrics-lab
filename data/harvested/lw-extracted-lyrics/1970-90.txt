Come Saturday morning. I'm goin' away with my friend. We'll Saturday-spend. 'Til the end of the day. Just I and my friend. We'll travel for miles. In our Saturday smiles. And then we'll move on. But we will remember. Long after Saturday's gone. Come Saturday morning. Come Saturday morning. Come Saturday morning. I'm goin' away with my friend. We'll Saturday-laugh. More than half of the day. Just I and my friend. Dressed up in our rings. And our Saturday things. And then we'll move on. But we will remember. Long after Saturday's gone. Come Saturday morning. Come Saturday morning. Come Saturday morning. Just I and my friend. We'll travel for miles. In our Saturday smiles. And then we'll move on. But we will remember. Long after Saturday's gone. Come Saturday morning. Come Saturday morning. Come Saturday morning. Come Saturday morning.
