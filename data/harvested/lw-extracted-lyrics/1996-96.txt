My lips are shaking, my nails are bit off. Been a month since I've heard myself talk. All the advantage this life's got on me. Picture a cup in the middle of the sea. And I fight back in my mind. Never lets me be right, oh. I got memories, I got shit. So much it don't show. I walked the line. When you held me in that night. I walked the line. When you held my hand that night. An empty shell seems so easy to crack. Got all these questions, don't know who I could even ask. So I'll just lie alone and wait for the dream. Where I'm not ugly and you're looking at me. And I'll stay in a bed. Oh could've seen it. If just once, I could feel loved. Oh, stare back at me, yeah. But I walked the line. When you held me in that night. Oh, I walked the line. When you held my hand that night. Oh, I walked the line. When you held me close at night. I paid the price, never held you in real life.
