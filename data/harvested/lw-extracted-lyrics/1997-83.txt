Oh my my my. I'm feeling high. My money’s gone. I'm all alone. Too much "we’ll see". The world keeps turnin'. Oh what a day. What a day. What a day. Peace and blessings manifest. With every lesson learned. If your knowledge were your wealth. Then it would be well-earned. If we were made in his image. Then call us by our names. Most intellects do not believe in God. But they fear us just the same. Oh on and on and on and on. (My cypher keeps movin' like a rollin' stone). Whew on and on and on and on. (All night until the break of dawn). I go on and on and on and on. (My cypher keeps movin' like a rollin' stone). Ooo on and on and on and on. (Godamnit Imma sing my song). I was born under water. With three dollars and six dimes. Yeah you might laugh. ‘Cause you did not do your math. Like 1.2.3. Damn, ya’ll feel that? Oh. Like 1.2.3. The world keeps turnin'. Oh what a day. What a day. What a day. The man that knows something. Knows that he knows nothing at all. Does it seem colder in your summertime. And hotter in your fall. If we were made in his image. Then call us by our names. Most intellects do not believe in God. But they fear us just the same. Oh on and on and on and on. (My cypher keeps movin' like a rollin' stone). On and on and on and on. (All night until you wrote your song). I go on and on and on and on and on on on. (My cypher keeps movin' like a rollin' stone). Ooo on and on and on and on. (Mad props to the god Ja Born). I am feeling kinda hungry. ‘Cause my high is coming down. Don't feed me yours. ‘Cause your food does not endure. I think I need a cup of tea. The world keeps burnin'. Oh what a day what a day what a day. Your rush into destruction. ‘Cause you don't have nothin' left. The mothership can't save you. So your ass is gonna get left. If we were made in his image. Then call us by our names. Most intellects do not believe in God. But they fear us just the same. Oh on and on and on and on. (My cypher keeps movin' like a rollin' stone). Oh on and on and on and on and on on on. (You can’t f*ck with me so jus' leave me alone). Ooh ooh wee on and on and on and on. (My cypher keeps movin' like a rollin' stone). Oh on and on and on and on.on.on. (And on and on).
