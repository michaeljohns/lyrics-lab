Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah. Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah. Yah-yah. (Chorus). When I step up in the place, ayo, I step correct. Woo-hah! I got you all in check. I got that head-nod s**t that make you break your neck. Woo-hah! I got you all in check. And you know we come through to wreck the discotheque. Woo-hah! I got you all in check. Throw your hands up in the air, don't ever disrespect. Woo-hah! I got you all in check. (1st verse). Busta Rhymes up in the place true indeed. Yes, I catch wreck and that's word on my seed. I'm guaranteed to give you what you need. One blood everybody like Junior Reid. Wake up every morning, yo, I must succeed. Nationwide ruckus make the world stampede. You really let me roll some w**d. Mad charged n***a, now I must proceed. Yo, we 'bout to make moves; set speed. Peace to Baby Mike, Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed. Watch me knock you out like Apollo Creed. Body blow bustin' your s**t making you bleed. Just feed off dynamic flows and take heed. Need more information homeboy then just read. Aya! You can read all about the pure breed. Do the bogle dance I'll do the pepperseed. -Chorus-. (Verse 2). How dare you ever try to step on my suede shoes? "Top Gun" shut down your firm like Tom Cruise. Please let me get down and blow a fuse. Actin' fool breakin' s**t down to molecules. Yo let me hit you with my ill street blues. Busta Rhymes always headlines the street news. Woo-hah! Yo, baby girl don't be confused. Sail my seven seas and enjoy my boat cruise. I know you really want to know who's comin' through leaving bloodstains and residues. Sorry, homeboy, but your flow sounds used. Gotta pay your dues, baby, you know the rules. Whenever I travel the world, I landcruise. If you choose to f**k around, you get bruised. Now I got you gassed on super unleaded fuels. Give me room, give me some space, yo excuse. -Chorus-. (Rampage) You now rockin' wit the best the boy scout is who I be. Flipmode is the sqaud Hah. Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah (8x). (Verse 3). Yo, which motherf**ka stole my flow? Eenie, meenie, miney, mo. Throw that type of n***a right out my window. Blast your a** hit you with my direct blow. Bo! Coming through like G.I. Joe. Star Wars movie deal like Han Solo. Make you bounce around like this was calypso. Always shine cause I got the high pro glow. You think that you can hide you think you can lay low. Roll up on your a** like Hawaii 5-0. Mad out with my dreads in my kangol. Forget the Moet n***a just pass the Cisco Yo! Take a trip down to Mexico. Come back with that shit that might make you psycho. Maximum frequencies through your stereo. Sorry this is it but homeboy I got to go. -Chorus-. Hah Yo Yo Yay Yo Yay Yo Yo Yay. Yay Yo Yay. Yay.
