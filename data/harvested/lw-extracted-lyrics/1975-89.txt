Walking through forests of palm tree apartments. Scoff at the monkeys who live in their dark tents. Down by the waterhole, drunk every Friday. Eating their nuts, saving their raisins for Sunday. Lions and tigers who wait in the shadows. They're fast but they're lazy, and sleep in green meadows. Well, let's bungle in the jungle. Well, that's all right by me, yes. Well, I'm a tiger when I want love. And I'm a snake if we disagree. Just say a word and the boys will be right there. With claws at your back to send a chill through the night air. Is it so frightening to have me at your shoulder? Thunder and lightning couldn't be bolder. I'll write on your tombstone, I thank you for dinner. This game that we animals play is a winner. Well, let's bungle in the jungle. Well, that's all right by me, yes. I'm a tiger when I want love. I'm a snake if we disagree. The rivers are full of crocodile nasties. And he who made kittens put snakes in the grass, he's. A lover of life, but a player of pawns. Yes, the king on his sunset lies waiting for dawn. To light up his jungle as play is resumed. The monkeys seem willing to strike up the tune. Well, let's bungle in the jungle. Well, that's all right by me, yes. I'm a tiger when I want love. And I'm a snake when we disagree. Yes, let's bungle in the jungle. Well, that's all right by me, yes. Well, I'm a tiger when I want love. I'm a snake when we disagree. Well, let's bungle in the jungle. Well, that's all right by me, yes. I'm a tiger when I want love.
