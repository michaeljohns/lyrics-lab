I like where we are. When we drive in your car. I like where we are. Here. 'Cause our lips can touch. And our cheeks can brush. Our lips can touch. Here. Well you are the one. The one that lies close to me. Whispers "Hello, I miss you quite terribly.". I fell in love. In love with you suddenly. Now there's no place else. I could be but here in your arms. I like where you sleep. When you sleep next to me. I like where you sleep. Here. Our lips can touch. And our cheeks can brush. 'Cause our lips can touch. Here. Well you are the one. The one that lies close to me. Whispers "Hello, I miss you quite terribly.". I fell in love. In love with you suddenly. Now there's no place else. I could be but here in your arms. Our lips can touch. Our lips can touch. Here. Well you are the one. The one that lies close to me. Whispers "Hello, I miss you quite terribly.". I fell in love. In love with you suddenly. Now there's no place else. I could be but here in your arms. Here in your arms. Well you are the one. The one that lies close to me. Whispers "Hello, I miss you, I miss you.". I fell in love. In love with you suddenly. Now there's no place else. I could be but here in your arms. Here in your arms. Here in your arms.
