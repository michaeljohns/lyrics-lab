If you need a friend. Don't look to a stranger. You know in the end, I'll always be there. But when you're in doubt. And when you're in danger. Take a look all around, and I'll be there. I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say. I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be. But if you wait around a while, I'll make you fall for me. I promise, I promise you I will. When your day is through. And so is your temper. You know what to do. I'm gonna always be there. Sometimes if I shout. It's not what's intended. These words just come out. With no gripe to bear. I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say. I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be. But if you wait around a while, I'll make you fall for me. I promise, I promise you I will. I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say. I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be. And if I had to walk the world, I'd make you fall for me. I promise you, I promise you I will. I gotta tell you. Need to tell you. Gotta tell you. I've gotta tell you. I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say. I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be. But if you wait around a while, I'll make you fall for me. I promise, I promise you. I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say. I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be. And if I had to walk the world, I'd make you fall for me. I promise you, I promise you I will. I will. I will.
