I can't remember when you weren't there. When I didn't care for anyone but you. I swear we've been through everything there is. Can't imagine anything we've missed. Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do. Through the years, you've never let me down. You turned my life around, the sweetest days I've found. I've found with you. through the years. I've never been afraid, I've loved the life we've made. And I'm so glad I've stayed, right here with you. Through the years. I can't remember what I used to do. Who I trusted, whom I listened to before. I swear you've taught me everything I know. Can't imagine needing someone so. But through the years it seems to me. I need you more and more. Through the years, through all the good and bad. I knew how much we had, I've always been so glad. To be with you. through the years. It's better every day, you've kissed my tears away. As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you. Through the years. Through the years, when everything went wrong. Together we were strong, I know that I belonged. Right here with you. through the years. I never had a doubt, we'd always work things out. I've learned what love's about, by loving you. Through the years. Through the years, you've never let me down. You've turned my life around, the sweetest days I've found. I've found with you. through the years. It's better everyday, you've kissed my tears away. As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you. Through the years!.
