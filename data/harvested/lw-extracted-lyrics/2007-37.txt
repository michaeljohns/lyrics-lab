I'm gonna make you bend and break. (It sent you to me without wings). Say a prayer but let the good times roll. In case God doesn't show. (Let the good times roll, let the good times roll). And I want these words to make things right. But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life. "Who does he think he is?". If that's the worst you've got better put your fingers back to the keys. One night and one more time. Thanks for the memories. Even though they weren't so great. "He tastes like you only sweeter.". One night yeah, and one more time. Thanks for the memories. Thanks for the memories. See, "He tastes like you only sweeter.". I'm looking forward to the future. But my eyesight is going bad. And this crystal ball. It's always cloudy except for (except for). When you look into the past (look into the past). One night stand. One night stand off. One night and one more time. Thanks for the memories. Even though they weren't so great. "He tastes like you only sweeter.". One night yeah, and one more time. Thanks for the memories. Thanks for the memories. See, "He tastes like you only sweeter.". They say I only think. In the form of crunching numbers. In hotel rooms. Collecting page six lovers. Get me out of my mind. Get you out of those clothes. I'm a liner away from. Getting you into the mood. One night and one more time. Thanks for the memories. Even though they weren't so great. "He tastes like you only sweeter.". One night yeah, and one more time. Thanks for the memories. Thanks for the memories. See, "He tastes like you only sweeter.". One night and one more time. (One more night, one more time). Thanks for the memories. Even though they weren't so great. "He tastes like you only sweeter.". One night yeah, and one more time. (One more night, one more time). Thanks for the memories. Thanks for the memories. See, "He tastes like you only sweeter.".
