I wake up every mornin', I stumble out of bed. Stretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead. It seems to last forever and time goes slowly by. Till babe and me's together, then it starts to fly. 'Cause the moment that he's with me, time can take a flight. The moment that he's with me, everything's alright. Night time is the right time, we make love. Then it's his and my time, we take off. My baby takes the morning train. He works from nine to five and then. He takes another home again. To find me waitin' for him. My baby takes the morning train. He works from nine to five and then. He takes another home again. To find me waitin' for him. He takes me to a movie or to a restaurant. To go slow dancing, anything I want. Only when he's with me, I catch light. Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright. My baby takes the morning train. He works from nine to five and then. He takes another home again. To find me waitin' for him. All day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly. I'm crazy mad for him and he's crazy mad for me. When he steps off that train, amazingly full of fight. Work all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night. My baby takes the morning train. He works from nine to five and then. He takes another home again. To find me waitin' for him. He's always on that morning train. He works so hard. To find me waiting for him.
