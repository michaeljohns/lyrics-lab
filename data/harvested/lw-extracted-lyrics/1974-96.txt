(Thom Bell and Linda Creed). Tootsie roll soul and doodle-white shoes. Papa's sure proud of his little bitty rockin' roll baby. Singin' at the age of two. He can hardly talk but he sure knows how to sing the blues. Little Joe never sings out of tune. Always in key, he's a soulful little rockin' roll baby. Papa loves the way you do. Never heard a boy sing the way my little Joey do. He was born in a theater in Bluefield, West Virginia. His ma and I were travelin' on the road. I worked hard all that summer as a fill-in for the drummer. One-night stands weren't easy for little Joe. Bought a new house in Beverly Hills. Papa made it big and he did it for his rockin' roll baby. A little bit of rhythm and blues. Got a funky walk in his little orthopedic shoes. He was born in a theater in Bluefield, West Virginia.
