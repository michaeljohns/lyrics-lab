Ooo la la la la. I did you wrong. My heart went out to play. And in came I lost you. What a price to pay, I'm cryin'. Ooo baby, baby. Ooo baby, baby. These days. I know I made you feel bad. But I'm only human. You've made mistakes too, I'm cryin'. Ooo baby baby. Ooo baby baby. Ooo baby baby. Ooo baby baby. I'm just about at the end of my rope but I can't stop tryin'. I can't give up hope, 'cause I'll be here. And someday I'll hold you near. Whisper I still love you, until that day is here, I'm cryin'. Ooo baby baby. Ooo baby baby. Ooo baby baby. Ooo baby baby. Ooo.
