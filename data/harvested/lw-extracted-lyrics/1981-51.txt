Somebody's knockin'. Should I let him in. Lord it's the devil. Would you look at him. I've heard about him. But I never dreamed. He'd have blue eyes and blue jeans. Well somebody's talkin'. He's whispering to me. Your place or my place. Well, which will it be. I'm gittin' weaker. And he's comin' on strong. But I don't wanna go wrong. He must have tapped my telephone line. He must have known. I'm spendin' my time. Alone. He says we'll have one heavenly night. My fever's burnin'. So he ought be right at home. Somebody's knockin'. Should I let him in.
