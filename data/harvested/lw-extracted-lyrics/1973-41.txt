Down around the corner. Half a mile from here. You see them long trains runnin'. And you watch 'em disappear. Without love. Where would you be now? Without love. You know I saw Miss Lucy. Down along the tracks. She lost her home and her family. And she won't be coming back. Without love. Where would you be right now? Without love. Well, the Illinois Central. And the Southern Central Freight. Got to keep on pushin', mama. 'Cause you know they're runnin' late. Without love. Where would you be now-na-na-now? Without love. Well, the Illinois Central. And the Southern Central Freight. Got to keep on pushin', mama. 'Cause you know they're runnin' late. Without love. Where would you be now? Without love. Well, pistons keep on churnin'. And the wheels go 'round and 'round. And the steel rails lie cold and hard. On the mountains they go down. Without love. Where would you be right now? Without love. Ooh, where would you be now? Mmm, got to get you, baby baby, won't you move it down? Won't you move it down? Baby, baby, baby, baby, won't you move it down? When the big train run. When the train is movin' on. I got to keep on movin'. Keep on movin'. Won't you keep on movin'? Gonna keep on movin'.
