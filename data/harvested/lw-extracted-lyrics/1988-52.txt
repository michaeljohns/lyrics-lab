. I wanna know. What you're thinking. There are some things you can't hide. I wanna know. What you're feeling. Tell me what's on your mind. Here I am in silence. Looking 'round without a clue. I find myself alone again. All alone with you. I can see behind your eyes. The things that I don't know. If you hide away from me. How can our love grow?. I wanna know. What you're thinking. There are some things you can't hide. I wanna know. What you're feeling. Tell me what's on your mind. I know I could break you down. But what good would it do? I could surely never know. That what you say is true. Here I am in silence. It's a game I have to play. You and I in silence. With nothing else to say. I wanna know. What you're thinking. There are some things you can't hide. I wanna know. What you're feeling. Tell me what's on your mind. I wanna know. What you're thinking. There are some things you can't hide. I wanna know. What you're feeling. Tell me what's on your mind. I wanna know. What you're thinking. There are some things you can't hide. I wanna know. What you're feeling. Tell me what's on your mind.
