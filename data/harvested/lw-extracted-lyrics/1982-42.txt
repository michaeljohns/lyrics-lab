I have a pocketfull of quarters. And I'm headed to the arcade. I don't have alot of money. But I'm bringing everything I made. I have a calis on my finger. and my shoulder's hurtin', too. I'm gonna eat 'em all up. Just as soon as they turn blue. 'Cause I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever). It's drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy). I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever). I'm goin' outta my mind (Goin' outta my mind). I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever). I'm goin' outta my mind (Goin' outta my mind). I've got all the patterns down. Up to the ninth key. I've got Speedy on my tail. And I know it's either him or me. So I'm heading out the back. Going in and out the side. Gonna eat all the cherries up. And take 'em all for a ride. I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever). It's drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy). I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever). I'm goin' outta my mind (Goin' outta my mind). I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever). I'm goin' outta my mind (Goin' outta my mind). I'm gonna faint to the left. Then move to the right. 'Cause Pokey's too slow. And Blinky's outta sight. Now I've got them on the run. And I'm lookin' for the high score. So it's once around the block. Then I stop back out the side door. UHH!! I'm really cookin' now. Eatin' everything in sight. All my money is gone. So I'll be back tommorrow night. 'Cause I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever). It's drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy). I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever). I'm goin' outta my mind (Goin' outta my mind). I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever). Drivin' me. Drivin' me. Drivin' me crazy. Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever). I'm goin' outta my mind (Goin' outta my mind). Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever). It's drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy). I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever).
