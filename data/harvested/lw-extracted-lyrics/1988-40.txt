She's like the wind, Through my tree. She rides the night. Next to me. She leads me through moonlight. Only to burn me with the sun. She's taken my heart. But she doesn't know what she's done. Feel her breath in my face. Her body close to me. Can't look in her eyes. She's out of my league. Just a fool to believe. I have anything she needs. She's like the wind. I look in the mirror. And all I see. Is a young old man. With only a dream. Am I just fooling myself. That she'll stop the pain? Living without her. I'd go insane! I feel her breath in my face. Her body close to me. Can't look in her eyes. She's out of my league. Just a fool to believe. I have anything she needs. She's like the wind. I feel your breath in my face. Your body close to me. Can't look in your eyes. You're out of my league. Just a fool to believe (Just a fool to believe). She's like the wind. (Just a fool to believe) Just a fool to believe. (She's like the wind). Just a fool to believe (Just a fool to believe). She's like the wind. (Just a fool to believe) Just a fool to believe. She's like the wind. (Just a fool.she's like the wind). (She's like the wind). (Just a fool.she's like the wind). (Just a fool.).
