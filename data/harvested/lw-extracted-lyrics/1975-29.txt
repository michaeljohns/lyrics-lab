Ooh-hoo-hoo, Jackie Blue. Lives her life from inside of a room. Hides her smile when she's wearing a frown. Ooh, Jackie, you're not so down. You like your life in a freeform style. You'll take an inch but you'd love a mile. There never seems to be quite enough. Floating around to fill your lovin' cup. Ooh-hoo-hoo, Jackie Blue. What's a game, girl, if you never lose? Ask a winner, and you'll probably find. Ooh, Jackie, they've lost at some time. Don't try to tell me that you're not aware. Of what you're doing and that you don't care. You say it's easy, just a natural thing. Like playing music, but you never sing. Ooh-hoo-hoo, Jackie Blue. Making wishes that never come true. Going places where you've never been. Ooh, Jackie, you're going again. Ooh-hoo-hoo, Jackie Blue. Lives a dream that can never come true. Making love is like sifting through sand. Ooh, Jackie, it slips through your hand. Every day, in your indigo eyes. I watch the sunset but I don't see it rise. Moonlight and stars in your strawberry wine. You'd take the world but you won't take the time. Ooh-hoo-hoo, Jackie Blue. Lives her life from inside of a room. Makes you think that her life is a drag. Ooh Jackie, what fun you have had. Ooh, Jackie. Ooh, Jackie. Ooh, Jackie. Ooh, Jackie. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
