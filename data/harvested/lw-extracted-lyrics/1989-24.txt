If you don't know me by now. You will never never never know me. All the things, that we've been through. You should understand me like I understand you. Now girl I know the difference between right and wrong. I ain't gonna do nothing to break up our happy home. Don't get so excited when I come home a little late at night. 'Cause we only act like children when we argue fuss and fight. If you don't know me by now (If you don't know me). You will never never never know me (No you won't). If you don't know by now. You will never never never know me. We've all got our funny moods. I've got mine, woman you've got yours too. Just trust in me like I trust in you. As long as we've been together it should be so easy to do. Just get yourself together or we might as well say goodbye. What good is a love affair when we can't see eye to eye. If you don't know me by now (If you don't know me). You will never never never know me (No you won't) (x3).
