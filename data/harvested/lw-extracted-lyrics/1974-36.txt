Hey, say, wait a minute. Where you going with that suitcase. Wait a minute, listen. All right, well, you don't have. To answer, just listen. I don't mind when you say. That you're going away. I just don't wanna be lonely. And I don't care if we. Share only moments a day. I just don't wanna be lonely. I'd rather be loved and needed. Depended on to give a love. I can't give when you're gone. When you're gone. I just don't want to be lonely. I'd rather be loved. I don't mind when the tide. Sets the sun to the moon. I just don't wanna be lonely. Let the stairs find you there. Waiting at the end of the room. I just don't wanna be lonely. I'd rather be loved and needed. Depended on to give a love. I can't give when you`re gone. When you're gone. I don't want to be lonely. I just wanna be loved, sugar. Come on. I just want to be loved. Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby. Ooh, Lord, have mercy. I'd rather be loved and needed. Depended on to give a love. I can't give when you`re gone. When you're gone. I don't want to be lonely. I wanna be loved, baby. Yeah, come on. Gimme that sweet love, sugar. I wanna be loved, baby. Gimme that love, sugar. Gimme that sweet, sweet. Sweet love, sugar. Gimme, gimme, gimme. That love, baby. I don't wanna be. Don't wanna be. I don't wanna be lonely, baby. No, no, no. Gimme that love, sugar. Come on, I don't wanna be lonely.
