. Everybody's got a thing. But some don't know how to handle it. Always reachin' out in vain. Just taking the things not worth having. But don't you worry 'bout a thing. Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama. 'Cause I'll be standing on the side. When you check it out. They say your style of life's a drag. And that you must go other places. But just don't you feel too bad. When you get fooled by smiling faces but. Don't you worry 'bout a thing. Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama. Cause I'll be standing on the side. When you check it out. When you get off. your trip. Don't you worry 'bout a thing. Don't you worry 'bout a thing. Don't you worry 'bout a thing. Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama. 'Cause I'll be standing in the side. When you check it out. When you get off. your trip. Everybody needs a change. A chance to check out the new. But you're the only one to see. The changes you take yourself through. But don't you worry 'bout a thing. Don't you worry 'bout a thing, pretty mama. 'Cause I'll be standing in the wings. When you check it out. Don't you worry 'bout a thing. (To do 'sta bien chévere).
