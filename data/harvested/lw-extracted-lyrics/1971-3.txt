Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time. There's something wrong here, there can be no denyin'. One of us is changing or maybe we've just stopped tryin'. And it's too late, baby, now it's too late. Though we really did try to make it. Something inside has died and I can't hide. And I just can't fake it. Oh no, no, no, no. It used to be so easy living here with you. You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do. Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool. And it's too late, baby, now it's too late. Though we really did try to make it. Something inside has died and I can't hide. And I just can't fake it. Oh no, no. There'll be good times again for me and you. But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it too. Still, I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you. But it's too late, baby, now it's too late. Though we really did try to make it. Something inside has died and I can't hide. And I just can't fake it. Oh no, no, no, no, no. It's too late, baby. It's too late, now darling. It's too late.
