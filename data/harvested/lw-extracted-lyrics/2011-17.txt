Right, right, turn off the lights. We're gonna lose our minds tonight. What's the dealio? I love when it's all too much. 5 AM turn the radio up. Where's the rock 'n' roll? Party crasher, penny snatcher. Call me up if you a gangsta. Don't be fancy, just get dancey. Why so serious? So raise your glass if you are wrong. In all the right ways, all my underdogs. We will never be, never be anything but loud. And nitty gritty, dirty little freaks. Won't you come on and come on and. Raise your glass? Just come on and come on and. Raise your glass. Slam, slam, oh hot damn. What part of "party" don't you understand? Wish you'd just freak out. Can't stop, coming in hot. I should be locked up right on the spot. It's so on right now. Party crasher, penny snatcher. Call me up if you a gangsta. Don't be fancy, just get dancey. Why so serious? So raise your glass if you are wrong. In all the right ways, all my underdogs.
