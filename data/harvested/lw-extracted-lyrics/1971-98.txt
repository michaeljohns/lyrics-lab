One less bell to answer. One less egg to fry. One less man to pick up after. I should be happy. But all I do is cry. (Cry, cry, no more laughter). Oh, I should be happy. (Oh, why did he go). I only know that since he left. My life's so empty. Though I try to forget. It just can't be done. Each time the doorbell rings. I still run. I don't know how in the world. To stop thinking of him. 'Cause I still love him so. I end each day the way I start out. Crying my heart out. Oh, one less man to pick up after. No more laughter. No more love. Since he went, oh he went away (he went away). (One less bell to answer). Why did he leave me. (Oh why, why, why did he leave). (One less bell to answer). Now I've got one less egg to fry. One less egg to fry. (Oh why, why, why did he leave). And all I do is cry. (One less bell to answer). Because my man told me goodbye. (Oh why, why, why did he leave). (One less bell to answer). Somebody tell me please. Where did he go, why did he go. (Ohy, why, why did he leave). Tell me, how could he leave me.
