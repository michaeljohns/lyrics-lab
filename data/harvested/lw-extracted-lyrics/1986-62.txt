Josie's on a vacation far away. Come around and talk it over. So many things that I want to say. You know I like my girls a little bit older. I just wanna use your love tonight. I don't wanna lose your love tonight. I ain't got many friends left to talk to. Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble. You know I'd do anything for you. Stay the night but keep it undercover. I just wanna use your love tonight, whoa. I don't wanna lose your love tonight. Try to stop my hands from shakin'. 'Cause somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense. It's been awhile since we were all alone. I can't hide the way I'm feelin'. As you're leaving, please, would you close the door? And don't forget what I told you. Just 'cause you're right, that don't mean I'm wrong. Another shoulder to cry upon. I just wanna use your love tonight, yeah. I don't wanna lose your love tonight. Yeah, I just wanna use your love tonight. I don't wanna lose your love tonight. I just wanna use your love tonight. I don't wanna lose your love tonight . (Lose your love). (Lose your love). Tonight (Lose your love). I don't wanna lose (Lose your love tonight). I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna (Lose your love tonight). No, no (Lose your love tonight). (Lose your love tonight). No, no (I don't wanna lose your love tonight). (Lose your love tonight).
