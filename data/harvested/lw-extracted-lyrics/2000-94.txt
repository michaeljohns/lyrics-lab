featuring JD & Xscape. [JD](Lil Bow Wow). Uh-huh, yo. (Oh, oh). Uh-huh, yo. (Uh-huh, oh, oh). Uh-huh, yo. (Bounce, bounce). See around here. (Uh-huh, uh, huh-uh). I make things that make y'all bounce. Ya know? Heh, ya know what I mean? (Yeah, yeah). Left to right, right to left. (Uh-huh, uh-huh). It's So So Def. (Yeah uh). And uh it's going down. Ya know what I mean? (Yeah). My man Bow Wow. (Bow Wow, yeah hear me now). Yeah ya heard? (Check it out). Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! (Peep game, let's go). [Lil Bow Wow]. Around here we pop them collars. Around here we get them dollars. Every girl I see that look right. A nigga like me just gotta holla. This kid here all about stackin' up. Got big head but we can back it up. Long cause everybody get crunk. When we drop in the club starts acting up. I represent the S-O-S-O, D-E-F-M-O-B. That's me, JD, Da Brat, and JE. So please believe. What I do ain't never been done. Ohio is where I'm from. I heard what you said. And I saw what you do. And y'all playas really don't want none. From the day to the night, I ROCK. Say what you like, NEVER NOT. Stayin' alive, living the life. Gots to keep it hot. Shotgun in the drop. Riding good, twenties, TVs, leather and wood. Poppin', watching Big Momma. Holdin' it down like a playa should. Sing-a-long now! [Xscape]. All I wanna do is see ya. Bounce with me, bounce with me. Grab a partner hit the floor. Bounce with me, bounce with me. Some clap, clap others stomp. But around here we get it crunk when ya. Bounce with me, bounce with me. All I wanna do is see ya. Bounce with me, bounce with me. Grab a partner hit the floor. Bounce with me, bounce with me. Some clap, clap others stomp.
