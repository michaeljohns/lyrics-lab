Oh, how 'bout a round of applause? Yeah, standin' ovation. Ooh, oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah. You look so dumb right now. Standin' outside my house. Tryin' to apologize. You're so ugly when you cry. Please, just cut it out. Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not. Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught. But you put on quite a show. Really had me going. But now it's time to go. Curtains finally closing. That was quite a show. Very entertaining. But it's over now. Go on and take a bow, uh oh oh. Grab your clothes and get gone. Ya better hurry up before the sprinklers come on. Talkin' 'bout, "Girl I love you, you're the one.". This just looks like a rerun. Please, what else is on? And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not. Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught. But you put on quite a show. Really had me going. But now it's time to go. Curtains finally closing. That was quite a show. Very entertaining. But it's over now. Go on and take a bow. Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you. For making me believe that you could be faithful to me. Let's hear your speech out. How 'bout a round of applause? A standin' ovation. But you put on quite a show. Really had me going. Now it's time to go. Curtains finally closing. That was quite a show. Very entertaining. But it's over now. Go on and take a bow. But it's over now.
