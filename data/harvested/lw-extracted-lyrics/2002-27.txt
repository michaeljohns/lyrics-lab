Please come now, I think I'm fallin'. I'm holdin' on to what I think is safe. It seems I found the road to nowhere. And I'm tryin' to escape. I yelled back when I heard thunder. But I'm down to one last breath. And with it let me say. Let me say. Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge. And I'm thinkin', maybe six feet, ain't so far down. I'm lookin' down now that it's over. Reflectin' on all of my mistakes. I thought I found the road to somewhere. Somewhere in His grace. I cried out, "Heaven save me". But I'm down to one last breath. And with it let me say. Let me say. Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge. And I'm thinkin', maybe six feet, ain't so far down. Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge. And I'm thinkin', maybe six feet, ain't so far down. I'm so far down. Sad eyes, follow me. But I still believe there's, somethin' left for me. So please come, stay with me. 'Cause I still believe there's, somethin' left for you and me. For you and me. For you and me. Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinkin'. Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge. And I'm thinkin', maybe six feet, ain't so far down. Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge. And I'm thinkin', maybe six feet, ain't so far down. Please come now, I think I'm fallin'. I'm holdin' on to what I think is safe.
