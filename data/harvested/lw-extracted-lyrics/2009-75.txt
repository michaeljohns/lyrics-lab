She had a shiny little beamer with the rag top down. Sittin in the drive, but she wouldn't get out. The dogs were all barkin and a waggin' around. And I just laughed and said y'all get in. She had on a new dress and she curled her hair. She was lookin' too good not to go somewhere. I said whatcha wanna do, baby I don't care. We can go to the show or we can stay right here and. I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor. We can go slow or make it go faster. Down through the woods and out to the pasture. Long as I'm with you, it really don't matter. Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to. Girl, you know you got me to hold on to. We can go to town, but baby if you'd rather. I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor. I said we can fire it up and I can show you around. Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down. When the fireflies are dancin and the moon comes out. We can turn on the lights and head back to the house, or. We can take another ride on my big green tractor. We can go slow or make it go faster. Down through the woods and out to the pasture. Long as I'm with you, it really don't matter. Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to. Girl, you know you got me to hold on to. We can go to town, but baby if you'd rather. I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor. Just let me dust off the seat.mmm. Now put your pretty little arms around me. Here we go. You can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to. Girl, you know you got me to hold on to. We can go to town, but baby if you'd rather. I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor. Oh yeah, yeah. We can go to town. Or we can go another round. On my big green tractor.
