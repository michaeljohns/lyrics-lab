Shadows grow so long before my eyes. And they're moving across the page. Suddenly the day turns into night. Far away from the city. But don't hesitate. 'Cause your love, your love won't wait, oh no no. Baby I love your way every day. Wanna tell you I love your way every day. Wanna be with you night and day. Hey, I love your way. If I leave here tomorrow. Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on now. There's so many places I've gotta see. But if I stayed here with you girl. Things just wouldn't be the same. 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now. And this bird will never change. And this bird will never change. Shadows grow so long before my eyes. With the help of some fireflies. I wonder how they have the power to shine. I can see them under the pines. But don't hesitate. 'Cause your love, your love won't wait. Ooh baby I love your way. Wanna tell you I love your way. Oh, baby I love your way. Every day now. Ooh wanna tell you I love your way. I love your way. Ooh baby I love your way. Give me you way, wanna tell you I love your way. Ooh baby I love your ways. Ooh baby I love your way. Ooh wanna tell you I love your way. Ooh baby I love your way. Ooh wanna tell you I love your way. Ooh baby I love your way.
