I need me a love that's 'gon make my heart stop now. And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples. Potential wife credentials. Know about the life I'm into, life I've been through. And how I had a trifilin mental. So ride with me, G Force fly with me. Times get hard cry with me, die with me. White beach sands lye with me. My advice is forget the limelight.

Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man. This is what I need. [Verse 2: Loon]. Listen to me now what should I say now? Come on ma. Been a whole day now I wanna lay 'round. And sip coladas, dipped in Prada. I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars. We out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass. 'Bout the size of a campaign ad. You don't know how you look to me. But if love was a crime you be a crook to me. Cause mommy I've done been around the world, seened alot of places. Been around your girl believe I read faces. I can tell she don't want me prevail. But I, learn my lesson watchin Sean bless it. So why listen to her and start guessin? Mommy you ain't ready to ride to start dressin. I need a girl receive my mom's blessin. Confession, my love no contestin. I need affection. [P. Diddy] Yes I need affection, let's go Mario! [Mario Winans]. Girl what the hell is on your mind. I could be dumb but I'm not blind. There's somethin leakin in your mind. Don't look to good for you and me, always did agree. That ain't what I need, baby!!! [Ginuwine & Mario Winans]. What I need,is a pretty woman next to me. ([Mario Winans:] Oh please baby). To share the dreams that I Believe. ([Mario Winans:] I need a girl in my life). Maybe we could start a family. ([Ginuwine:] Start a family baby). Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man. This is what I need. [Verse 3: P. Diddy]. Ay yo the sun don't shine forever. But as long as were here then we might as well shine together. Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together. Build a love that a last forever. So let's stop the pain, stop the rain. Put, stress to rest girl stop the games. Name the spot, mommy I got the plane. Roll through rough, I got the range. Ma I got some thangs, knowned to put rocks in rings. Push a hundred foot yachts and thangs. Your man don't play, have you ever bee to Sandro Pe? Or seened a brotha play Amando Lay? Girl I wanna just, look in your eyes and watch the sunrise. No more lies, no more tears to cry. No more reasons for leavin, do I believe in? Love you till the day I stop breathin, I love you girl. [Chorus: Ginuwine & Mario Winans]. What I need, is a pretty woman next to me. ([Ginuwine:] Standin next to me girl). To share the dreams that I Believe. ([Ginuwine:] When I wake up in the morning). Maybe we could start a family. ([Ginuwine:] I wanna see your pretty face, yeah). Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man. This is what I need. ([Female singer:] Is that all you want?). Is a pretty woman next to me. ([Female singer:] Made the sacrifice). To share the dreams that I believe. ([Female singer:] And maybe maybe we). Maybe we could start a family. Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man. This is what I need, is a pretty woman next to me. To share the dreams that I Believe. Maybe we could start a family. Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man. This is what I need.
