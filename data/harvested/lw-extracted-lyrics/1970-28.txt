Let me tell you now. When I had you to myself. I didn't want you around. Those pretty faces always made you. Stand out in a crowd. But someone picked you from the bunch. One glance was all it took. Now it's much too late for me. To take a second look. Oh baby, give me one more chance. Won't you please let me. Back in your heart. Oh darling, I was blind to let you go. But now since I see you in his arms. Yes I do now. Ooh, ooh baby. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Na na na na. Trying to live without your love. Is one long sleepless night. Let me show you, girl. That I know wrong from right. Every street you walk on. I leave tear stains on the ground. Following the girl. I didn't even want around. Let me tell you now. Oh baby, all I need is one more chance. Won't you please let me. Back in your heart. Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go. But now since I see you in his arms, uh huh. A buh buh buh buh. A buh buh buh buh. All I want. A buh buh buh buh. All I need. A buh buh buh buh. All I want. A buh buh buh buh. All I need. Oh, just one more chance. To show you that I love you. Baby (baby), baby (baby), baby (baby). Forget what happened then. And let me live again. Oh baby, I was blind to let you go. But now since I see you in his arms. Spare me of this cause. Gimme back what I lost. Oh baby, I need one more chance, ha. I tell ya that I love you. Baby, ow, baby, baby. I want you back. I want you back.
