Even if you were a million miles away. I could still feel you in my bed. Near me, touch me, feel me. And even at the bottom of the sea. I could still hear inside my head. Tellin' me, touch me, feel me. And all the time you were tellin' me lies. So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you. Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you. I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight. I'm gonna find a way to make it without you. Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart? Well, you could try sleeping in my bed. Lonely, own me nobody ever shut it down like you. You wore the crown. You made my body feel heaven bound. Why don't you hold me. Near me, I thought you told me. You'd never leave me. Looking in the sky I could see your face. And I know right where I fit in. Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love. With you. Right til the end OOh. So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you. Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you. I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight. I'm gonna find a way to make it without you. Anybody could've told you right from the start. It's about to fall apart. So rather than hold on to a broken dream. Or just hold on to love. And I could find a way to make it. Don't hold on too tight. I'll make it without you tonight. So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you. Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you. I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight. I'm gonna find a way to make it without you.
