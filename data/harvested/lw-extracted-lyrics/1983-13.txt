Come on, Eileen. Come on, Eileen. Poor old. Sounded sad upon the radio. Moved a million hearts in mono. Made our mothers cry. Sang along, who'd blame them? You're grown. So grown. Now I must say, more than ever. Toora-loora-toora-loo-rye-ay. And we can sing just like our fathers. Come on, Eileen, oh, I swear. At this moment, you mean everything. With you in that dress, my thoughts. Verge on dirty. Ah, come on, Eileen. Come on, Eileen. These people 'round here. Were beaten down, eyes sunk in smoke, dried faces. So resigned to what their fate is. But not us. No, not us. We are far too young and clever. Go toora-loora-toora-loo-rye-ay. Eileen, I'll hum this tune forever. Come on, Eileen, oh, I swear. Ah, come on, let's take off everything. That pretty red dress, Eileen. Ah, come on, let's. Ah, come on, Eileen. That pretty red dress, Eileen. Ah, come on, let's. Ah, come on, Eileen, please. Now you are grown, and now you have shown, oh, Eileen. You're grown. So grown. Now I must say more than ever. Things 'round here will change. I said toora-loora-toora-loo-rye-ay. Come on, Eileen, oh, I swear. At this moment, you mean everything. With you in that dress, my thoughts. Verge on dirty. Ah, come on, Eileen. Come on, Eileen, oh, I swear. At this moment, you mean everything. Whoa, my thoughts. Well, they're dirty. Come on, Eileen. Come on, Eileen, whoa-oh-oh. Oh-ho-ho-ho. Ah come on, Ah come on.
