All my life was a paper once plain, pure and white. Till you moved with your pen changing moods now and then. Till the balance was right. Then you added some music, every note was in place. And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face. And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part. And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart. You decorated my life. Like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song. There was no harmony life meant nothin' to me, until you came along. And you brought out the colors, what a gentle surprise. Now I'm able to see all the things life can be shining soft in your eyes. And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part. And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart. You decorated my life.
