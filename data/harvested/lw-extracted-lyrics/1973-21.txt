Who's that lady. Beautiful lady. Who's that lady. The real, real, real fine lady. I wish somebody would introduce her to me. I didn't get a chance. To ask her to dance. It was love at first sight. I just saw her tonight. And I wish somebody would introduce her to me. I like the way she danced in the dark. And disappeared in the night. And oh she stole my heart. It was love at first sight. Who's that lady. Beautiful lady. Who's that lady. I gotta meet that lady. And I wish somebody would introduce her to me. Who's that lady. That real fine lady. Who's that lady. That beautiful lady. I wish somebody would introduce her to me. Say hey lady. I'm in love with you.
