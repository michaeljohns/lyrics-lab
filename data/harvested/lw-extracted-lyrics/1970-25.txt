I found love on a two-way street (I found love). And lost it on a lonely highway (I lost love, I lost love). Love on a two-way street (I found love). And lost it on a lonely highway (I lost love, I lost love). True love will never die. So I've been told. But now I must cry. It is finally goodbye, I know. With music softly playing. Her lips were gently saying "I love you" (I love you, I love you). She held me in desperation. I thought it was a revelation. And then she walked out. How could I be so blind. To give up love the very first time? To be fooled is a hurting thing. To be loathed and fooled is a crying shame. While I bear the blame. As she laughs my name. With music softly playing. Her lips were gently saying "Honey, I love you" (I love you, I love you). She held me in desperation. I thought it was a revelation. And then she walked out. I found love on a two-way street (I found love). And lost it on a lonely highway (I lost love, I lost love). Love on a two-way street (I found love). And lost it on a lonely highway (I lost love, I lost love).
