. 1. Try to remember that kind of September, when. When life was slow and oh, so mellow, hum. Try to remember, and if you remember then follow. Oh, why does it seem the past is always better. We look back and think. The winters were warmer. The grass was greener. The skies were bluer. And smiles were bright. 2. Can it be that it was all so simple then. Or has time rewritten every line. And if we had the chance to do it all again. Tell me. Would we. Could we. Memories, like the corners of my mind. Misty watercolor memories. Of the way we were. Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind. Smiles we gave to one another. For the way we were. Hahaa. Oh, can it be that it was all so simple then. Or has time rewritten every line. And if we had the chance to do it all again. Tell me. haha. Would we. Could we. Memories, may be beautiful and yet. What's too painful to remember. We simply choose to forget. So it's the laughter we will remember. Whenever we remember. The Way We Were. Remember, the way we were.
