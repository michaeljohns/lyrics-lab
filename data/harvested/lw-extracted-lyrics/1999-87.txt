You betta count your money (Repeat 8X). (Krayzie Bone). The name is Krazie, big bad ass bone. Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole. Along with some cash, even took the mayors daughter. That that there's kidnapped, now she was with her. so I brought her. Done got myself into a whole heep of trouble. Double crossed by the law so theres nobody to run to. Yeah its just me and my sawed off shotgun. Outlaw call him Leather Face. I'm headed for the west. Heard they got a couple banks in town that ain't. been held up yet. Well uh, I oughta make it by sundown. I figure thats enough time for me to get the whole. run down. So I continue my mission. Its gettin dark so now now I'm watchin for them. damn injuns. They like to catch us, then they rob and split. I be a rootin, tootin damn fool, protecting my chips. All of the sudden I heard somebody rumble in the. bushes. Stop my horse "wwhhooaa nellie". Who in the bushes you betta speak out or I'ma let. my shotgun song sing out. (Thug Queen). Who is this? Hope this ain't the law. Jumped out the bushes with my sawed off shotgun. (Krazie Bone). Come on out right now I'm gettin angry. Took a step back cause it could get dangerous. (Thug Queen). Please don't shoot its just me Thug Queen the horse. stealer. (Krazie Bone). Then why the hell is you hidin them bushes. (Thug Queen). I'm wanted in four counties. For armed robberies. Killed two sheriffs, six of his best men want my. head. Stole two horses.
