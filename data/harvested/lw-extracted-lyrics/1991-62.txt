So you say that you can't go on. Love left you cryin'. And you say all your hope is gone. And what's the use in tryin'. What you need is to have some faith. Shake off those sad blues. Get yourself a new view. Oh, nothing is a sad as it seems, you know. 'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache. Someday, you'll laugh at the pain. Somehow you'll get through the heartache. Somehow you can get through the rain. When love puts you through the fire. When love puts you through the test. Nothing cures a broken heart. Like time, love and tenderness. When you think your world is over. Baby just remember this. Nothing heals a broken heart. Like time, love and tenderness. Time, love and tenderness. I understand how you're feeling now. And what you've been through. But your world's gonna turn around. So baby don't you be blue. All it takes is a little time. To make it better. The hurt won't last forever. Oh, all the tears are gonna dry you know. 'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache. Someday you'll laugh at the pain. You may be down on your luck. But baby that old lucks gonna change. When love puts you through the fire. When love puts you through the test. Nothing cures a broken heart. Like time, love and tenderness. When you think your world is over. Baby just remember this. Nothing heals a broken heart. Like time, love and tenderness. Time, love and tenderness. Baby, oh baby you just need some. You just need some. Time, love and tenderness. Time, love and tenderness. The hurt ain't gonna last forever. Time, love and tenderness. Time, love and tenderness.
