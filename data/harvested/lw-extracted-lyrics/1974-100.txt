Once there was a boy and girl. Boy said "I love you so". Girl said "I'll never leave you". They grew older and left each other. 'Cause that's the way love goes. That's the way love goes. Then there's a time. Seems like you'll never find. Someone willing to love you. Keep on lookin', you'll soon discover. A mighty love. Will sometimes make you weep and moan. A mighty love. You'll sit all day by the telephone. 'Cause you're all alone. You need a mighty love. Hey. Some say that you're sure to find. True love and peace of mind. At the end of a rainbow. There's no sign in the sky to follow. 'Cause that's the way love goes. Baby, that's the way love goes. And so there's a rhyme. That says life will soon be fine. Love is just what you make it. Keep on lovin', you'll soon discover. A mighty love. Will sometimes make a weak man strong. A mighty love. Will sometimes make a rich man weep. And knock him off his feet. To have a mighty love. Mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty, Mighty, mighty love jones. Comin' down on me baby yeah. Hey, hey. I can feel the world getting' brighter. Brighter with your lovin'. You see baby. With a mighty love you can. Sometimes turn the world around. With a mighty love you can, you can. Turn the world around sometimes, Yes you can, uh. Hey baby. Makes music have a ha-ha-happy sound. Makes you move, makes you groove. You got the feelin' head is reelin'. Come on. Ha ha. I gon' gon' gon' gon' get your lovin'.
