Freeze frame. I could see it was a rough-cut Tuesday. Slow-motion weekdays stare me down. Her lipstick reflex got me wound. There were no defects to be found. Snapshot image froze without a sound. Thursday morning was a hot-flash factor. Her face still focused in my mind. Doo-dloo-dloo. Test-strip proofsheet love is hard to find. Doo-dloo-dloo. Friday night, we danced the spotlight grind. Doo-dloo-dloo. Stop time heart for me if she's not mine. Freeze frame, freeze frame. Freeze frame, freeze frame. Freeze frame, freeze frame. Freeze frame, whoo, and I freeze. Now I'm looking at a flashback Sunday. Zoom lens feeling just won't disappear. Doo-dloo-dloo. Close up, dark room, sweet talk in my ear. Doo-dloo-dloo. Her hot-spot love for me is strong. Doo-dloo-dloo. This freeze-frame moment can't be wrong. Freeze frame, freeze frame. Freeze frame, freeze frame. Freeze frame, freeze frame. Freeze frame, whoo, and I freeze. Shoot, shoot - doo-dloo-dloo. Shoot, shoot - doo-dloo-dloo. Shoot, shoot - doo-dloo-dloo. Freeze frame, freeze frame. Freeze frame, freeze frame. Freeze frame, freeze frame. Freeze frame, whoo, and I freeze. Yeah. Freeze frame, oh yeah, freeze frame. If I could freeze frame, freeze frame, freeze frame. If I could freeze, she's real, whoo, freeze frame. If I could freeze, she's ahhh, freeze frame. If I could shoot, shoot - doo-dloo-dloo, freeze frame. If I could shoot, shoot - doo-dloo-dloo, freeze frame.
