Well me and my lady had our first big fight. So I drove around till I saw the neon lights. The corner bar. It just seemed right, so I pulled up. Not a soul around but the old bar keep. down at the end lookin' half asleep. He walked up and said "What'll it be?". I said,"The good stuff". He didn't reach around for the whiskey. He didn't pour me a beer. His blue eyes kind of went misty. He said, "You can't find that here.". CHORUS 1. Cause its the first long kiss on a second date. your momma's all worried when you get home late. Droppin the ring in the spaghetti plate. cause your hands are shakin so much. It's the way that she looks with rice in her hair. Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year. and askin for seconds to keep her from tearin' up. Yeah man, that's the good stuff. He grabbed a carton of milk. and he poured a glass. then I smiled and said, "I'll have some of that.". We sat there and talked as an hour passed. like old friends. Saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare. It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair. He said, "That's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed.". He said, "Spent 5 years in the bottle, when the cancer took her from me, But Ive been sober 3 years now. 'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey. Chorus 2. Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl. The way she adored that string of pearls. I gave her the day that our youngest boy Earl, married his high school love. and it's a new t-shirt saying "I'm a grandpa". and being right there as our time got small, And holdin her hand when the good Lord called her up. Yeah man, That's the good stuff. BRIDGE. He said,. Im sorry, So am I.
