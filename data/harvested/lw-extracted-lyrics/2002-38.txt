Tell you what I did last night. I came home, say, around a quarter to three. Still so high. Hypnotized. In a trance. From the start it, so butter and brown and tantalizing. You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt. So shook I had to catch my breath. Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head. Oh my. OOPS, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet. Oh my. Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my leg. Oh my. Ooh I'm turning red. Who could this be?. I tried and I tried to avoid. But this thing was happening. Swallow my pride. Let it ride and party. But this body felt just like mines. I got worried. I looked over to the left. A reflection of myself. That's why I couldn't catch my breath. OOPS, there goes my shirt up over my head. Oh my. OOPS, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet. Oh my. Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my leg.. (Fabolous). Desert storm yeah, Fabolous yeah. Tweet yeah. Shorty I strictly wanna spank you. The most I gotta do. Is spell my name to get your vicki's to your ankles. I'm seriously mami, you're fuckin' with the Kid. Aka William H. Bonnie. You know I'm the type that be crushin and merkin'. Having ladies touchin' the hurkin, blushin' and smirkin',. Early in the morning rushin from workin'. Screamin "Oh my. F-A B-O L-O U-S". Each night I'm freakin, ma' you aint gonna talk me to death,. Cuz you got free nights and weekends. Ghetto Fabs all over the place. Oops, there goes my kids all over your face. Oh my! (Missy). (I looked over to the left). Umm I was looking so good I couldn't reject myself. (I looked over to the left). Umm I was feeling so good I had to touch myself. (I looked over to the left). Umm I was eyein my thighs butter pecan brown. (I looked over to the left). Umm comin' outta my shirt and then the skirt came down. OOPS, there goes my shirt up over my head. Oh my. OOPS, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet. Oh my. Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my leg. Oh my. Ooh I'm turning red. Who could this be?. OOPS, there goes my shirt up over my head. Oh my. OOPS, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet. Oh my. Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my leg. Oh my. Ooh I'm turning red. Who could this be?. Mmm. (oh my). OOPS, there goes my shirt up over my head. OOPS. Oh my.
