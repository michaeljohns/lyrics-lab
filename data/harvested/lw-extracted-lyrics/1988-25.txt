I've been meaning to tell you. I've got this feelin' that won't subside. I look at you and I fantasize. You're mine tonight. Now I've got you in my sights. With these hungry eyes. One look at you and I can't disguise. I've got hungry eyes. I feel the magic between you and I. I wanna hold you so hear me out. I wanna show you what love's all about. Darlin' tonight. Now I've got you in my sights. With these hungry eyes. One look at you and I can't disguise. I've got hungry eyes. I feel the magic between you and I. Now I've got you in my sights. With these hungry eyes. Now did I take you by surprise. I need you to see. This love was meant to be. With these hungry eyes. One look at you and I can't disguise. I've got hungry eyes. I feel the magic between you and I. Now I've got you in my sights. With these hungry eyes. Now did i take you by surprise. I need you to see. This love was meant to be. I got Hungry Eyes.
