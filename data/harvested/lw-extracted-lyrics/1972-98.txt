It sure is. Everyone's trying to get out in the rain. Oh, it feels so good. The rain and thinking of you. Soon as I get home, I'm gonna call you. And tell you, how much I love you. Oh, I feel so good. Oh, I just. Walking in the rain with the one I love. Feel so fine. Walking in the rain with the one I love. On my mind. To each is own, I've heard them say. Well, I got mine in so many ways, yeah. Like being together, whether near or far. It doesn't matter where you are. So in love with each other. Giving love so warm and free. Made our dream a reality. Then it'll last forever and ever. With every step we take. And every breath we make. Darling, just you and me. Oh, I just. Walking in the rain with the one I love. Feel so fine. Walking in the rain with the one I love. On my mind. So in love with each other. With every passing day we share. The thought of knowing someone cares. Just being together. Making love so tenderly. Exploding into ecstasy. Then it'll last forever and ever. Together we hold the key. To make forever our destiny. Oh, I just. Walking in the rain with the one I love. Feel so fine. Walking in the rain with the one I love. On my mind. I'm gonna call him right now. Gee, I hope he's home. Hello. Baby, I'm home. I've got something to tell you. What? I love you. Oh, I love you too. Did you get caught in the rain? Oh, yes. It was so beautiful. Let me tell you how it started. Walking in the rain with the one I love.
