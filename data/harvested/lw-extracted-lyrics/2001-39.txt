Well I just heard the news today. It seems my life is going to change. I close my eyes, begin to pray. Then tears of joy stream down my face. With arms wide open. Under the sunlight. Welcome to this place. I'll show you everything. With arms wide open. With arms wide open. Well I don't know if I'm ready. To be the man I have to be. I'll take a breath, I'll take her by my side. We stand in awe, we've created life. With arms wide open. Under the sunlight. Welcome to this place. I'll show you everything. With arms wide open. Now everything has changed. I'll show you love. I'll show you everything. With arms wide open. With arms wide open. I'll show you everything, oh yeah. With arms wide open, wide open. If I had just one wish. Only one demand. I hope he's not like me. I hope he understands. That he can take this life. And hold it by the hand. And he can greet the world. With arms wide open. With arms wide open. Under the sunlight. Welcome to this place. I'll show you everything. With arms wide open. Now everything has changed. I'll show you love. I'll show you everything. With arms wide open. With arms wide open. I'll show you everything, oh yeah. With arms wide open. Wide open.
