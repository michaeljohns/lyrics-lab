It's 12 past midnight, don't close your eyes. Your soul's half alive, and I'll be by your side. I've come to take you there, show you how to care. Just be aware, that you'll have to share. 1-I want your love, I want it tonight. I'm taking your heart, so don't you fight. I'll be your answer, I'll be your wish. I'll be your fantasy, your favorite dish. 2-From the back to the middle and around again. I'm gonna be there til the end. 100% pure love. (repeat 2). You saw a brand new high, thought that you could fly. Did I hear you cry, or did you like the ride. You call my name again, no it's not a sin. I'll show you how to win, and where I've been. (rpt 1, 2, 2, 2). You'll never have to run away. you'll always have a friend to play. You'll never go out on your own. In me you will find a home, home.
