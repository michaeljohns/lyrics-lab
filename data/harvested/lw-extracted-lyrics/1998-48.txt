(feat. Chill). [1:]. It's like Romeo and Juliet. Hot sex on a platta' just to get you wet. You's about to get in somthin' you will never regret. And it's gonna be the bomb this is what I bet. Yep! It's like Romeo and Juliet. Hot sex on a platta' just to get you wet. You's about to get in somthin' you will never regret. And it's gonna be the bomb this is what I bet. Yep! Since the first time I saw ya. I knew I was attracted. Reacted to the fact. On how ya make me act. Shy but sexy at the same time. Always on my mind was a little bump and grind. Usually I don't play it that close. You got's to kick it wit me. Before I serve you up. With an overdose. Of that bomb-ass puh-nanny. Make you my man. I ain't got no love. For nobody else but you. Cuz you's my boo. I prove to you. My love be true. So do you know where you goin' to. Through thick and thin, baby. You all in, time will reveal. That my love for you will never end. My heart keep tickin'. No time for trickin'. You who I'm pickin'. So lay me down. Just give it a good lickin'. I'll treat you like my king. Cuz you royal. And only give my love to you. Because I'm loyal, escape with me. Come over to my place. I'll teach you a few things in love makin'. Now I can't wait, I won't wait. So take me by my arms and rock me baby. Cuz I'mma always and forever be yo lady. [1]. After our first night. You discovered who's the bombest mommy. L.A.'s finest with my top dogs all around me. Down to ride, harder than Bonnie and Clyde. We're sexual healers, do ya feel this. Baby, check my vibe. They'll never be a love like me. That got your back in this industry. That got your back in these streets. So you don't have to worry 'bout me. On the creep. And I don't want you ever to try to. Play me cheap. Cuz I don't sleep around. Because it's sleezy. Good lesson taught by my big homey E-Z. I got to compliment you on how you please me. Touch me, but don't tease me. Now put it in nice and easy. And rub my body down I'm feeling wheezy. And cuddle up to me. Cuz now I'm getting sleepy. But I'mma be dedicated. To this relation. So stay away from all them cowboys. So we can not be playa hated. Cuz if you wit me boo, then keep it real. And if I catch you sleepin' around. Then I'm gon' have to chill. When ya find good love. You best to keep it. I'm puttin' all my sista's up on game. So whyn't cha' peep it. [1: until fade].
