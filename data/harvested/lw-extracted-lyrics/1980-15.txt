I realize the best part of love. is the thinnest slice. and you don't care for much. but I'm not letting go. i believe there's still much to believe in. So lift your eyes if you feel you can. reach for a star and I'll show you a plan. I've figured it out what I needed was someone to show me. You know you can't fool me. I've been lovin you too long. It started so easy, You'll want to carry on. (carry on). Lost in love and I don't know much. cos I'm thinkin aloud and I fell out of touch. but I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted.
