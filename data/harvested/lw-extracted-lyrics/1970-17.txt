Cracklin' Rosie, get on board. We're gonna ride till there ain't no more to go. Taking it slow. Lord, don't you know. Have made me a time with a poor man's lady. Hitchin on a twilight train. Ain't nothing here that I care to take along. Maybe a song. To sing when I want. Don't need to say please to no man for a happy tune. Oh, I love my Rosie child. You got the way to make me happy. You and me, we go in style. Cracklin Rose, you're a store bought woman. You make me sing like a guitar hummin'. So hang on to me, girl. Our song keeps runnin' on. Play it now. Play it now. Play it now, my baby. Cracklin Rosie, make me a smile. Girl if it lasts for an hour, that's all right. We got all night. To set the world right. Find us a dream that don't ask no questions, yeah.
