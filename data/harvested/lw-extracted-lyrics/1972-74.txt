Whenever I chance to meet some old friends on the street. They wonder how does a man get to be this way. I've always got a smilin' face any time and any place. And everytime they ask me why I just smile and say. You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'. And let her know you think about her when you're gone. Kiss an angel good mornin' and love her like a devil when you get back home. Well people may try to guess the secret of happiness. But some of them never learn it's a simple thing. The secret I'm speaking of is a woman and a man in love. And the answer is in the song that I always sing. You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'. Kiss an angel good mornin'.
