. Yes, it's over, call it a day. Sorry that it had to end this way. No reason to pretend. We knew it had to end some day, this way. Guess it's over, the kicks are gone. What's the use of tryin' to hang on. Somewhere we lost the key. So little left for you and me and it's clear to see. Too much, too little, too late to lie again with you. Too much, too little, too late to try again with you. We're in the middle of ending something that we knew. It's over. Oh, it was over. Too much, too little, too late to ever try again. Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends. Too much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end. Ah, it's over. It's over. Guess it's over, the chips are down. Nearly all our bridges tumbled down. Whatever chance we try, let's face it, why deny. It's over. It's over. Too much, too little, too late to ever try again. Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends. Too much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end. And it's over. And it's over. And it's over. Too much, too little, too late to ever try again. Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends.
