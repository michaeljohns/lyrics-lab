. La la la la la la. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Hey baby my nose is getting big. I noticed it be growin when I be telling the fibs now. You said your trust is getting weaker. Prolly cuz my lies just started getting deeper. And the reason for my confession. Is that I learned my lesson. And I really think you ought to know the truth. Because I lied and I cheated. And I lied a little more. But after what you did. I don't know what I did it for. I admit that I've been a little immature. Fucked with your heart. Like I was the predator. In my book of lies. I was the editor. And the author. I forged my signature. And I apologize for what I did to ya. Cuz what you did to me I did to you. No no no no baby. No no no no don't lie. Cuz ya know know know know. Yeah ya know know know know you gotta try. What you gonna do when it all comes out. When I'm here to see you. And what you're all about. No no no no baby. No no no no dont lie. Cos you know you know you know you know you know you gotta try. Stop st-stop stop st-stop stop lyin. She said I'm leaving. She can't take the pain. Its hard to continue. This love it aint the same. Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain. To many lies commited to many gains. She feeling like a fool. Getting on the last train. Tryin to maintain. But the feeling won't change. Im sorry for the thing that ive done. And what I became. Caught up in living my life in the fast lane. Surrounded by lights, cameras you know the fame. I dont know the reason why I did these things. Oooooh and I lie and I lie and I lie and I lie. And now our emotions are drained. And I lie and I lie. And a little lie lie. And now your emotions are drained. No no no no baby. No no no no don't lie (no don't you lie). Cos ya know know know know. Yeah ya know know know know you gotta try. What ya gonna do when it all comes out. When I'm here to see you. And what you're all about. No no no no baby. No no no no don't lie. Because you know, you know, you know, you know you gotta try. (Hoohoohoohoo hoohoohoo repeated 12 x. Badabada repeated 8 x). Yo I'm lying to my girl. Even though I love her. And she all in my world. I give her all my attention. And diamonds and pearls. She the one who makes me feel. On top of the world. Still I'm lying to my girl I do it. And I lie and I lie and I lie and then I lie. Till there's no turning back. I don't know why I lie and I lie. Till I don't know who I am. Then I tell myself. No no no no baby. No no no no don't lie (Don't you lie!). Cos ya know know know know. Yeah ya know know know know you gotta try (you know you know you gotta). What ya gonna do when it all comes out. When I'm here to see you. And what you're all about. No no no no baby.
