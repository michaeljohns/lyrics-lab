Many years since I was here. On the street I was passin' my time away. To the left and to the right, buildings towering to the sky. It's outta sight in the dead of night. Here I am, and in this city. With a fistful of dollars. And baby, you'd better believe. I'm back, back in the New York Groove. I'm back, back in the New York Groove. I'm back, back in the New York Groove. Back in the New York Groove, in the New York Groove. In the back of my Cadillac. A wicked lady, sittin' by my side, sayin'. Stop at Third and Forty-three, exit to the night. It's gonna be ecstacy, this place was meant for me. I feel so good tonight. Who cares about tomorrow. So baby, you'd better believe. I'm back, back in the New York Groove. I'm back, back in the New York Groove. I'm back, back in the New York Groove. Back in the New York Groove, in the New York Groove. I'm back, back in the New York Groove. I'm back, back in the New York Groove. I'm back, back in the New York Groove. I'm back, back in the New York Groove. I'm back, back in the New York Groove. I'm back, back in the New York Groove. I'm back, back in the New York Groove. I'm back, back in the New York Groove. I'm back, back in the New York Groove. I'm back, back in the New York Groove.
