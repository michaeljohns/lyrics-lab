I have often dreamed, of a far off place, Where a hero's welcome, would be waiting for me, Where the crowds will cheer, when they see my face, And a voice keeps saying, "this is where I'm meant to be.". I'll be there someday, I can go the distance. I will find my way, if I can be strong, I know every mile, will be worth my while, When I go the distance I'll be right where I belong. Down an unknown road, to embrace my fate. Though the road may wander, it will lead me to you, And a thousand years, would be worth the wait. It may take a lifetime, but somehow I'll see it through. And I won't look back, I can go the distance. And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat. It's an uphill slope, but I won't lose hope. Till I go the distance, and my journey is complete. But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part. For a hero's strength is measured by his heart. Like a shooting star, I will go the distance. I will search the world, I will face its harms. I don't care how far, I can go the distance. Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms. I will search the world, I will face its harms, Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms.
