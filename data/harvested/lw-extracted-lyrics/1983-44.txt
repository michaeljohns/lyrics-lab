No one looked.as I walked by. Just an invitation would have been just fine. Said no to him.again and again. First he took my heart.and then he ran. No one knows how I feel. What I said unless you read between my lines. One man walked away from me. First he took my hand.take me home. Stand back.stand back. In the middle of my room. I did not hear from you. It's alright.it's alright. To be standing in a line. (Standing in a line). To be standing in a line. I cry. Do not turn away my friend. Like a willow I can bend. No man calls my name. No man came. So I walked on down away from you. Maybe your attention was more. Than you could do. One man did not call. He asked me for my love. And that was all. Stand back.stand back. In the middle of my room. I did not hear from you. It's alright.it's alright. To be standing in a line. (Standing in a line). To be standing in a line. I cry. So I walked on down the line. Away from you. Maybe your attention was more. Than I could do. One man.did not call. Well he asked me for my love. That was all. Stand back. stand back. In the middle of my room I did not hear from you. It's alright. it's alright. To be standing in a line. (Standing in a line). To be standing in a line. I cry.
