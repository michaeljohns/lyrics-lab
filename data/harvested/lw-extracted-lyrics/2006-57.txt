Two, three, four. (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo). (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo). Well my heart knows me better than I know myself. So I'm gonna let it do all the talking. (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo). I came across a place in the middle of nowhere. With a big black horse and a cherry tree. (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo). I felt a little fear, upon my back. I said, "Don't look back, just keep on walking.". (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo). When the big black horse said, "Look this way.". He said, "Hey lady, will you marry me?". (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo). But I said, "No, no. No, no-no-no. "No, no. You're not the one for me. "No, no. No, no-no-no. "No, no. You're not the one for me.". (Ooooo, woo-hoo). No, no, no, no. And my heart had a problem, in the early hours, So I stopped it dead for a beat or two. (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo). But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done that, And it won't forgive me after all these years. (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo). So I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere. With a big black horse and a cherry tree. (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo). Now It won't come back, cause it's oh so happy. And now I've got a hole for the world to see. (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo). And It said, "No, no, no, no-no-no. "No, no, you're not the one for me. "No, no, no, no-no-no. "No, no, you're not the one for me.". (Ooooo, woo-hoo) (not the one for me, yeah-eh). (Ooooo, woo-hoo). Said no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no-no. You're not the one for me. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no-no. You're not the one for me. Big black horse and a cherry tree. I can't quite get there cause my heart's forsaken me. Big black horse and a cherry tree. I can't quite get there cause my heart's forsaken me.
