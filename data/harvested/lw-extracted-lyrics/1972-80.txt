Yeah, I know what you're talkin' about. ahh,. There was a time when man did live in caves as we all know. These people were known as cave men, neanderthal men or troglodytes. What we're gonna do right here is go back, way back, back into time. When the only people that existed were troglodytes. cave men. Cave women. Neanderthal. troglodytes. Let's take the average. Cave man at home, listening to his stereo. Sometimes he'd get up, Try to do his thing. He'd begin to move, something like this:. "Dance. dance". When he got tired of dancing alone, he'd look. In the mirror: "Gotta find a woman gotta find a woman gotta find a. Woman gotta find a woman". He'd go down to the lake where all the. Woman would be swimming or washing clothes or something. He'd look. Around and just reach in and grab one. "Come here. come here". He'd grab her by the hair. You can't do that today, fellas, cause. It might come off. You'd have a piece of hair in your hand and she'd. Be swimming away from you (ha-ha). This one woman just lay there, Wet and frightened. He said: "Move. move". She got up. She was a. Big woman. BIG woman. Her name was Bertha. Bertha Butt. She was one. Of the Butt sisters. He didn't care. He looked up at her and said:. "Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me. Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me!". She looked down on him. She was ready to crush him, but she began to like him. She said. (Falsetto):. "I'll sock it to ya, Daddy". He said: "Wha?". She said (falsetto):. "I'll sock it to ya, Daddy". You know what he said? He started it way. Back then. I wouldn't lie to you. When she said (falsetto). "I'll sock it to ya, Daddy" he said "Right on! Right on! Hotpants! Hotpants! Ugh. ugh. ugh".
