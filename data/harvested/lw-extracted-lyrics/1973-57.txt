Have I a hope for half a chance. To even ask if I could dance with you, yoo-hoo? Would you greet me or politely turn away? Would there suddenly be sunshine on a cold and rainy day? Oh, babe, what would you say? For there are you, sweet lollipop. Here am I with such a lot to say, hey, hey. Just to walk with you along the Milky Way. To caress you through the nighttime, bring you flowers every day. Oh, babe, what would you say? 'Cause oh, baby, I know. I know I could be so in love with you. And I know that I could make you love me, too. And if I could only hear you say you do, oo-oo-oo-oo. But, anyway, what would you say? Yes, oh, baby, I know. I know I could be so in love with you. And I know that I could make you love me, too. And if I could only hear you say you do, oo-oo-oo-oo. But, anyway, what would you say?.
