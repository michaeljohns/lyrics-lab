Just got home from Illinois, Lock the front door, oh, boy! Got to sit down, Take a rest on the porch. Imagination sets in, Pretty soon I'm singin'. Doo, doo, doo, Lookin' out my back door. There's a giant doing cartwheels, A statue wearin' high heels. Look at all the happy. Creatures dancing on the lawn. A Dinosaur Victrola. List'ning to Buck Owens. Doo, doo, doo, Lookin' out my back door. Tambourines and elephants. Are playing in the band. Won't you take a ride. On the flyin' spoon? Doo, doo-doo. Wond'rous apparition. Provided by magician. Doo, doo, doo, Lookin' out my back door. Tambourines and elephants. Are playing in the band. Won't you take a ride. On the flyin' spoon? Doo, doo-doo. Bother me tomorrow, Today I'll buy no sorrows. Doo, doo, doo, Lookin' out my back door. Forward troubles Illinois, Lock the front door, oh, boy! Look at all the happy. Creatures dancing on the lawn. Bother me tomorrow, Today I'll buy no sorrows. Doo, doo, doo, Lookin' out my back door.
