Who's the black private dick. That's a sex machine to all the chicks?. (Shaft). You're damn right. Who is the man. That would risk his neck for his brother man? (Shaft). Can you dig it? Who's the cat that won't cop out. When there's danger all about? (Shaft). Right on. They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother. (Shut your mouth). But I'm talkin' 'bout Shaft. (Then we can dig it). He's a complicated man. But no one understands him but his woman. (John Shaft).
