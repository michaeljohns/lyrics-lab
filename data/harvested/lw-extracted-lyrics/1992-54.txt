When a man loves a woman. Can't keep his mind on nothin' else. He'd trade the world. For the good thing he's found. If she is bad, he can't see it. She can do no wrong. Turn his back on his best friend. If he puts her down. When a man loves a woman. Spend his very last dime. Trying to hold on. To what he needs. He'd give up all his comforts. Sleep out in the rain. If she said that's the way. It oughta be, hey. When a man loves a woman, hey. I give you everything I've got. Trying to hold on to your precious love. Baby, baby please don't treat me bad. When a man loves a woman. Deep down in his soul. She can bring him. Such misery. If she is playing him for a fool. He's the last one to know. Loving eyes. Can never see. Yes when a man loves a woman. I know exactly how he feels. 'Cause, baby, baby. When a man loves a woman, oh. When a man loves a woman, yeah. When a man loves a woman. When a man, when a man, when a man loves a woman. Mmm.
