Take the ribbon from my hair. Shake it loose and let it fall. Lay it soft upon my skin. Like the shadows on the wall. Come and lay down by my side. Til the early mornin' light. All I'm takin' is your time. Help me make it through the night. Chorus:. I don't care what's right or wrong. I won't try to understand. Let the devil take tomorrow. But tonight I need a friend. Yesterday is dead and gone. And tomorrow's out of sight. And it's sad to be alone. Help me make it through the night. (Repeat Chorus).
