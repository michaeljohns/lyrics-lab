[Intro]. Baby let me explain to you, I'm sayin. What you sayin? It's not even like that! It wasn't like that? But I saw you. Baby I don't love her. You don't love me. You know what, I don't even want to talk to you. She don't mean nothing to me!.I don't want to see ya face. She was just telling me--. I just want to see you walking through that door. Baby, don't--.there ain't nothing else to say. Why we gotta do it like this? Peace. Baby--DAMN! [Verse 1]. Come home late. It seems you barely beat the sun. Tapping my shoulder thinking you gon get you some. Smelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear. So if you want some lovin, I suggest you go back there. Where you came from. Day to Day with you it's always something else. Working my nerve, God knows that I don't deserve. What you put me through cause I been so true to you. For you to come at me with another lame excuse. See I. [Chorus]. (heard it all before). All of ya lies, all of ya sweet talk. "Baby" this, "Baby" that. (down). (played the fool before). I was your fool I believed in you. Yes I did yes I did. (down). [Verse 2]. What were you thinking bringing her into our home. In our bed, you must have fell and bumped your head. Messing up my sheets and violating me. Got me 'bout to call my peeps and take it to the streets. Nothing you can do. And there's nothing you can say. That could persuade me to stay with you another day. You have crossed the line to the point of no return. What you do from here on out. I am no longer concerned. See I.. [Chorus]. (heard it all before). "Let me explain, baby, it's not what you think". That's what you said to me. (had to shut you down). Now I. (played the fool before). You got a good game I must admit, I was it, but now it's over. (down). [Bridge]. Use to hang on to your every word (every word). But the more you lie to me the more I hurt. The things you use to say would sound so sweet (sound so sweet). I was naive. Quick to believe. [Chorus]. Heard it all before. "I was at work. It wasn't my car you saw. Baby, I swear it wasn't me!". (down). (played the fool before). You were my boo I trusted you for way too long (way too long). (now). You know you messed up (You got to know you messed up). You got to go now, say what you want. (down, down, down, down). (Played the fool). I done change the locks on the door (Yes I did). And you ain't welcome no more (You ain't welcome no more). (look who's hurting now?). See I heard it all before.
