In the day, in the night. Say it right, say it all. You either got it or you don't. You either stand or you fall. When your will is broken. When it slips from your hand. When there's no time for joking. There's a hole in the plan. Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me. No, you don't mean nothing at all to me. But you got what it takes to set me free. Oh, you could mean everything to me. I can't say. that I'm not. At a loss. and at fault. I can't say. that I don't. Love the light. and the dark. I can't say that I don't. Know that I am alive. And I love what I feel. I could show. you tonight, you tonight. Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me. No, you don't mean nothing at all to me. But you got what it takes to set me free. Oh, you could mean everything to me. From my hands, I could give you. Something that I made. From my mouth, I could sing you. Another brick that I laid. From my body. I could show you. A place. God knows. You should know, this space is holy. Do you really wanna go?.
