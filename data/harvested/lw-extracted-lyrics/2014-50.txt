Oooh girl ya shining. Like a 5th Avenue diamond. And they don't make you like they used to. You're never going out of style. Oooh pretty baby. This world might have gone crazy. The way you save me who can blame me when. I just wanna make you smile. I wanna thrill you like Michael. I wanna kiss you like Prince. Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye like Hathaway. Write a song for you like this. You're over my head. I'm out of my mind. Thinking I was born. In the wrong time. One-of-a-kind living in a world gone plastic. Baby you're so classic. 4 dozen roses. Anything for you to notice. All the way to serenade you. Doing it Sinatra style. I'ma pick you up in a Cadillac. Like a gentleman bringing glamour back. Keep it real to real and the way I feel. I could walk you down the aisle. I wanna thrill you like Michael. I wanna kiss you like Prince. Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye like Hathaway. Write a song for you like this. You're over my head. I'm out of my mind. Thinking I was born. In the wrong time. It's love on rewind. Everything is so throw back-ish. I kind of like it how you're. Out of my league. Old school chic. Like a movie star. From the silver screen. You're one-of-a-kind living in a world gone plastic. Baby you're so classic. Baby you're class and baby you're sick. I never met a girl like you ever till we met. A star in the forties, centerfold in the fifties. Got me tripping out like the sixties. Hippies Queen of the discotheque. A seventies dream and an eighties best. Hepburn, Beyoncé, Marilyn, Massey. Girl you're timeless, just so classic.
