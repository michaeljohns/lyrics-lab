There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'. Just as fast as my feet can fly. Come away, come away, if you're goin'. Leave the sinkin' ship behind. Come on the risin' wind. We're goin' up around the bend. Ooh. Bring a song and a smile for the banjo. Better get, while the gettin's good. Hitch a ride to the end of the highway. Where the neon's turn to wood. Come on the risin' wind. We're goin' up around the bend. Ooh. You can ponder perpetual motion. Fix your mind on a crystal day. Always time for a good conversation. There's an ear for, what you say. Come on the risin' wind. We're goin' up around the bend. Yeah. Ooh. Catch a ride to the end of the highway. And we'll meet by the big red tree. There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'. Come along, come along with me. Come on the risin' wind. We're goin' up around the bend. Yeah. Do-do-doo-do. Do-do-doo-do. Do-doo-do. Do-do-doo-do. Yeah. Do-do-doo-do. Do-do-doo-do. Do-do-doo. Do-do-doo.
