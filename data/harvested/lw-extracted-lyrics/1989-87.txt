Hello, it's me again. Don't you know it's hard to keep a good woman down. But then again, maybe that could be fun. Sa-Sa-Sa-Sa-Samantha Fox! Ain't it funny how when I say let's go out. You're always saying someone else will get me. What's a girl to do - I like to have fun too. But you're so jealous - you never let me. So how come you can leave - but when it comes to me. Always something I must prove. You know I love you - always thinking of you. But tonight - I've got to make that move. I wanna have some fun. Move my body all night long. I wanna have some fun. Move my body all night long. Working 9 to 5 each and every day. What your momma used to say - All work - No play. I know what to do - I think I'll call my crew. Of course, I love you - but naughty girls need fun too. Could it be that I make you feel guilty why. Is there something I can't see - NO. I just don't buy it - so don't even try it. I've got to go in the place to be. I wanna have some fun. Move my body all night long. Working hard every day. So I ain't staying home no way. I need it. I want it. Got to. Flaunt it. I'm not a prisoner - can't you see. Unlock the door so I can breathe. Whenever it comes to you my dear. I say stay with me but you still go. So now I learn, it's my turn. I want you to stay here with me. You can have fun with me. With you? Yeah, with me! Come on. I can have loads of fun without you. Without me? Yeah!.
