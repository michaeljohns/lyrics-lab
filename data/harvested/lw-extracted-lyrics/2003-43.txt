Where they live life fast and they scared of dark. There was a little nigga by the name of Cris. Nobody paid him any mind. No one gave a shit. Knowing he could rap. No one lift a hand. So he went about his business and devised a plan. Made a CD then he hit the block. 50 thousand sold. Seven dollars a pop. Hold the phone. Three years later. Stepped out the swamp. With ten and a half gators. Now all around the world on the microphone. He leave the booth smelling like Burberry cologne. Still riding chrome. Got bitches in the kitchen. Never home alone. And he's on the grind. Please let me know if he's on your mind. And respect you'll give me. Ludacris I live loud like Timmy. Uh had to clear these rumors. I got a headache and it's not a tumor. Get up on my lap get my head sucked right. Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite. Hard to the core. Core to the right. You drop down turn around pick a bale of cotton. [Chorus].
