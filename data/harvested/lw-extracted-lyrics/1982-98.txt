Once in your life you find her. Someone that turns your heart around. And next thing you know you're closing down the town. Wake up and it's still with you. Even though you left her way 'cross town. Wondering to yourself, "Hey, what've I found?". When you get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true. If you get caught between the moon and New York City. The best that you can do. The best that you can do. Is fall in love. Arthur, he does as he pleases. All of his life, his master's toys. Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy. Living his life one day at a time. And showing himself a pretty good time. Laughing about the way they want him to be. When you get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true. If you get caught between the moon and New York City. The best that you can do. The best that you can do. Is fall in love. When you get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true. If you get caught between the moon and New York City. The best that you can do. The best that you can do. Is fall in love. When you get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true. If you get caught between the moon and New York City. The best that you can do. The best that you can do. Is fall in love. When you get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
