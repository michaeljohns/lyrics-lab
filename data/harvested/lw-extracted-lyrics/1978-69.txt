. Summer lovin' had me a blast. Summer lovin' happened so fast. I met a girl crazy for me. Met a boy cute as can be. Summer days driftin' away. To ah, oh, those summer nights. Uh well-a well-a well-a huh!. Tell me more, tell me more. Did you get very far?. Tell me more, tell me more. Like does he have a car? Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh. She swam by me, she got a cramp. He ran by me, got my suit damp. I saved her life, she nearly drowned. He showed off, splashing around. Summer sun, something's begun. But ah, oh, those summer nights. Uh well-a well-a well-a huh!. Tell me more, tell me more. Was it love at first sight? Tell me more, tell me more. Did she put up a fight? Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh. Took her bowling in the arcade. We went strolling, drank lemonade. We made out under the dock. We stayed out 'til ten o'clock. Summer fling, don't mean a thing. But ah, oh, those summer nights. Whoa, whoa, whoa!. Tell me more, tell me more. But you don't gotta brag. Tell me more, tell me more. 'Cause he sounds like a drag. Shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop. Shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, yeah!. He got friendly, holding my hand. Well, she got friendly down in the sand. He was sweet, just turned eighteen. Well, she was good, you know what I mean. Summer heat, boy and girl meet. But ah, oh, those summer nights. Whoa, whoa, whoa!. Tell me more, tell me more. How much dough did he spend? Tell me more, tell me more. Could she get me a friend?. It turned colder, that's where it ends. So I told her we'd still be friends. Then we made our true love vow. Wonder what she's doing now. Summer dreams ripped at the seams. But oh, those summer nights. Tell me more, tell me more.
