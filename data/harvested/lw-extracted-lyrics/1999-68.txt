I do, I do, babe. I do, I do. All I am, all I'll be. Everything in this world. All that I'll ever need. Is in your eyes. Shining at me. When you smile, I can feel. All my passion unfolding. Your hand brushes mine. And the thousand sensations. Seduce me 'cause I. I do cherish you. For the rest of my life. You don't have to think twice. I will love you still. From the depths of my soul. It's beyond my control. I've waited so long to say this to you. If you're asking do I love you this much. Well, I do. In my world, before you. I lived outside my emotions. Didn't know where I was going. 'Til that day I found you. How you opened my life. To a new paradise. In a world torn by change. Still with all of my heart. 'Til my dying day. And I do cherish you. For the rest of my life. You don't have to think twice. I will love you still. From the depths of my soul. It's beyond my control. I've waited so long to say this to you. If you're asking do I love you this much. Yes, I do. If you're asking do I love you this much. Baby, I do. I'll cherish you. This much I know it's true. From the depths of my soul. It's beyond my control. I've waited so long to say this to you. If you're asking do I love you this much. Baby, I do. Oh oh, I do.
