Hello my friend, we meet again - It's been a while. Where should we begin? - Feels like forever. Within my heart are memories, of perfect love, That you gave to me - Oh, I remember. When you are with me, I'm free, I'm careless, I believe. Above all the others, we'll fly. This brings tears to my eyes. My sacrifice. We've seen our share of ups and downs. Oh, how quickly life can turn around, in an instant. It feels so good to reunite - Within yourself, And within your mind - Let's find peace there. 'Cause, When you are with me, I'm free, I'm careless, I believe. Above all the others, we'll fly. This brings tears to my eyes. My sacrifice. I just want to say hello again. I just want to say hello again. 'Cause. When you are with me, I'm free, I'm careless, I believe. Above all the others, we'll fly. This brings tears to my eyes. My sacrifice, My sacrifice. I just want to say hello again. I just want to say hello again. My sacrifice.
