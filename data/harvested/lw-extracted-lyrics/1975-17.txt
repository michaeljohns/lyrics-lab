It's lonely out tonight. And the feeling just got right for a brand new love song. Somebody done somebody wrong song. Hey, won't you play another. Somebody done somebody wrong song. And make me feel at home. While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby. So please, play for me a sad melody. So sad that it makes everybody cry. A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong. 'Cause I don't wanna cry all alone. Hey, won't you play another. Somebody done somebody wrong song. And make me feel at home. While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby. So please, play for me a sad melody. So sad that it makes everybody cry. A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong. 'Cause I don't wanna cry all alone. Hey, won't you play another. Somebody done somebody wrong song. And make me feel at home. While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby. Hey, won't you play another. Somebody done somebody wrong song. And make me feel at home. While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby. Hey, won't you play another. Somebody done somebody wrong song. And make me feel at home. While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby.
