Over by the window. There's a pack of cigarettes. Not my brand, you understand. Sometimes the girl forgets. She forgets to hide them. I know who left those smokes behind. She'll say, "Oh, he's just a friend". And I'll say, "Oh, I'm not blind to. Him, him, him". What's she gonna do about him? She's gonna have to do without him. Or do without me, me, me. No one gets to get it for free. It's me or it's him. Don't know what he looks like. Don't know who he is. Don't know why, she thought that I. Would say what's mine is his. I don't want to own her. But I can't let her have it both ways. Three is one too many of us. She leaves with me, or stays with. Him, him, him. What's she gonna do about him? She's gonna have to do without him. Or do without me, me, me. No one gets to get it for free. It's me or it's him. Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh. Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh. Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh. Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh. If she wants to, she can have him. Just exactly how we once were. It's goodbye to you and I. Back to her and I without. Him, him, him. What's she gonna do about him? She's gonna have to do without him. Or do without me, me, me. No one gets to get it for free. Time for me to make the girl see. It's me or it's him, him, him. What's she gonna do about him? She's gonna have to do without him. Or do without me, me, me.
