Thinkin' back in time. When love was only in my mind, I realize. Ain't no second chance. You've got to hold on to romance, don't let it slide. There's a special kind of magic in the air. When you find another heart that needs to share. Baby, come to me. Let me put my arms around you. This was meant to be. And I'm oh so glad I found you. Need you every day. Gotta have your love around me. Baby, always stay. 'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you. Spendin' every dime to keep you talkin' on the line. That's how it was. And all those walks together out in any kind of weather. Just because. There's a brand new way of looking at your life. When you know that love is standing by your side. Baby, come to me. Let me put my arms around you. This was meant to be. And I'm oh so glad I found you. Need you every day. Gotta have your love around me. Baby, always stay. 'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you. The nights can be cold. There's a chill to every evenin' when you're all alone. Don't talk anymore. 'Cause you know that I'll be here to keep you warm. Oh, darling keep me warm. Baby, come to me. Let me put my arms around you. This was meant to be. And I'm oh so glad I found you. Need you every day. Gotta have your love around me. Baby, always stay. 'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you. Baby, come to me. Let me put my arms around you. This was meant to be. And I'm oh so glad I found you. Need you every day. Gotta have your love around me. Baby, always stay. 'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you.
