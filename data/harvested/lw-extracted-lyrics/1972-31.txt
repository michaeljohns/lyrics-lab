Last night, I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no. I lay awake and watched until the morning light. Washed away the darkness of the lonely night (Lonely night). Oh, and last night, I got to thinking maybe I, I, I. Should call you up and just forget my foolish pride. I heard your number ringing, I went cold inside. And last night, I didn't get to sleep at all. I know it's not my fault, I did my best. God knows this heart of mine could use a rest. But more and more I find the dreams I left behind. Are somehow too real to replace (Replace). Oh, last night, I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no. The sleeping pill I took was just a waste of time. I couldn't close my eyes 'cause you were on my mind. And last night, I didn't get to sleep, didn't get to sleep. No, I didn't get to sleep at all. But more and more I find the dreams I left behind. Are somehow too real to replace (Replace). Oh, last night, I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no. The sleeping pill I took was just a waste of time. I couldn't close my eyes 'cause you were on my mind. And last night, I didn't get to sleep, didn't get to sleep. No, I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no, no. (No, no, no) No, no, no. Oh, last night, I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no. Last night, I didn't get to sleep at all, oh, oh. Last night.
