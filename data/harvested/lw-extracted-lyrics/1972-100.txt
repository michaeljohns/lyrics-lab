Pop that thang. Bang, bang, bang. Pop that thang. Bang, bang, bang. Ting a ling a ling. I hook it on up. Get on down. Now do your stuff. Come on. Pop that thang. Bang, bang, bang. Pop that thang. Bang, bang, bang. If you can't do it right. Don't you try it again. Look at that rooster. Runnin' after that hen. Come on. Pop that thang. Bang, bang, bang. Pop that thang. Bang, bang, bang. Sister Rosaline. Ting a ling a ling. Look at that child. Popping that thang. Hitch up to my wagon. And get ready to roll. But don't get on board. If you can't carry the load. If balloon goes down. I fill it up with wind. If the record stops. Start it over again. Pop that thang. Bang, bang, bang. Pop that thang. Bang, bang, bang. Ting a ling a ling. Hook it on up. Get on down. And do your own stuff. Pop that thang. Bang, bang, bang. Pop that thang. Bang, bang, bang. If you can't do it right. Don't you try it again. Look at that rooster. Running after that hen. Come on and pop it. Pop it, pop it, pop it. Come on and pop it. Pop it, pop it, pop it. Come on and pop it.
