Id like to build the world a home. And furnish it with love. Grow apple trees and honey bees and snow-white turtle doves. I'd like to teach the world to sing. In perfect harmony. I'd like to hold it in my arms and keep it company. I'd like to see the world for once. All standing hand in hand. And hear them echo through the hills "Ah, peace throughout the land". (That's the song I hear). I'd like to teach the world to sing (that the world sings today). In perfect harmony. I'd like to teach the world to sing. In perfect harmony. Id like to build the world a home. And furnish it with love. Grow apple trees and honey bees and snow-white turtle doves.
