I'll never hear the bells if you leave me. I'll never hear the bells. I'll never hear the bells if you leave me. I'll never hear the bells. Do you hear what I hear. When your lips are kissing mine. Do you hear the bells honey. Do you hear them ringing. When I'm kissing you baby. What do I have to do. To make you feel the tingling too. Can't you hear the bells honey. Say it's just as good to you as it is to me. I hear the bells. I hear the bells. Oh ringing in my ears. Oh saying do you love me do you love me. Do you love me, do you love me. Like I love you oh baby. True love and joy and faith. And all my strength I'll give to you darling. My love is yours exclusively to enjoy. Any way you want to. One thing I want you to remember. If you ever leave. I believe I'll go insane. Darling I'll never hear the bells again. No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh baby don't leave me, don't leave me baby.
