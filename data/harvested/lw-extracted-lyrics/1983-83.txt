You won't forget my eyes. Ooh deep inside you realize. You're gonna see me wherever you go. You're gonna hear me on your radio. There you are in your car. And suddenly. You hear me. "Do you want me. Do you want me". Take me to heart. I promise you a miracle. Take me to heart. You're gonna be mine. Take me to heart. You know it's just a matter of time. I'm always on your mind. I'm the chill that never left your spine. In the building where you live and breathe. I'm the sound that never lets you sleep. Down the hall through the walls. You hear a voice that's calling. "Do you want me. Do you want me". Take me to heart. Don't deny the miracle. Take me to heart. What more can I say. Take me to heart. Surrender's just a motion away. (Repeat).
