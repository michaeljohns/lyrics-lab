Ooh, baby. Anytime my world gets crazy. All I have to do to calm it. Is just think of you. 'Cause when I think of you, baby. Nothin' else seems to matter. 'Cause when I think of you, baby. All I think about is our love. I just get. More attached to you when. You hold me in your arms and squeeze me. And you leave me, makin' me blue. 'Cause then I think of you, baby. Nothin' else seems to matter. 'Cause when I think of you, baby. All I think about is our love. So in love. Ooh. With you. Baby. Ooh. Hee. With you. When I think of you. When I think of you. Bass. I'm so in love. I just think of you. If you're not around, I'm. When I think of you. Ooh. So in love. With you. Baby, you. Ooh. So in love. With you. Hahahaha. Feels so good. When I think of you. Yeah, yeah. Baby.
