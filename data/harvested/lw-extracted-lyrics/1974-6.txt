Everybody's doin' a brand new dance now. I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now. My little baby sister can do it with ease. It's easier than learnin' your ABCs. So, come on, come on. And do the Loco-Motion with me. You've got to swing your hips now. Come on. Jump up. Jump back. Oh well, I think you've got the knack. Woah, woah. Now that you can do it, well let's make a chain now. A chuga-chuga motion like a railroad train, now. Do it nice and easy now and don't lose control. A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul. Well come on, come on. And do the Loco-Motion with me. Woah, woah. Move around the floor in a loco-motion. Do it holdin' hands if'n you get the notion. There's never been a dance that's so easy to do. It even makes you happy when you're feelin' blue. So come on, come on. And do the Loco-Motion with me. So come on, come on. And do the Loco-Motion with me. So come on, come on. And do the Loco-Motion with me.
