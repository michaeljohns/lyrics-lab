When no one else can understand me. When everything I do is wrong. You give me love and consolation. You give me hope to carry on. And you're always there. To lend a hand. In everything I do. That's the wonder, the wonder of you. And when you smile, the world is brighter. You touch my hand and I'm a king. Your love to me is worth a fortune. Your love for me is everything. I guess I'll never know. The reason why. You love me as you do. That's the wonder, the wonder of you. I guess I'll never know. The reason why. You love me as you do. That's the wonder, the wonder of you.
