If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right. If being right means being without you. I'd rather live a wrong doing life. Your mama and daddy say it's a shame. It's a downright disgrace. Long as I got you by my side. I don't care what your people say. Your friends tell you there's no future. In loving a married man. If I can't see you when I want to. I'll see you when I can. If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right. If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right. Am I wrong to fall so deeply in love with you. Knowing I got a wife and two little children. Depending on me too. And am I wrong to hunger. For the gentleness of your touch. Knowing I got somebody else at home. Who needs me just as much. And are you wrong to fall in love. With a married man. And am I wrong trying to hold on. To the best thing I ever had. If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right. If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right. Are you wrong to give your love. To a married man. And am I wrong trying to hold on. To the best thing I ever had. If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right. If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right. I don't wanna be right. If it means sleeping alone at night. I don't wanna be right. If it means coming home at night. I don't wanna, I don't wanna. I don't wanna never, never, never be right.
