You Are On My Mind, You Are On My Mind. [Chorus:]. Every Little Thing I Do You're On My Mind. The Way I Feel Lately, It's Driving Me Crazy. Every Little Thing I Do You're On My Mind. I Can't Get Over You, I Think About You All The Time. Can't You See What You Do To Me. I Think About You All The Time. My Mind Is Hazy And I'm Mixed Up Feeling Crazy Over You. Let's Not Waste Anytime. [Chorus]. Round And Round I Go, Where I'll Stop Only You Know. I Guess It's All In My Mind. Take Your Time Think It Over Let Me Know. What You Wanna Do, Baby It's So Good. [Chorus]. Every Little Thing I Do You're On My Mind. You're On My Mind, Hey. [Chorus x2: Fade].
