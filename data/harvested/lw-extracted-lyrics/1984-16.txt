You've gone too far this time. And I'm dancing on the valentine. I tell you somebody's fooling around. With my chances on the danger line. I'll cross that bridge when I find it. Another day to make my stand, oh whoa. High time is no time for deciding. If I should find a helping hand, oh whoa. Why don't you use it? Try not to bruise it. Buy time, don't lose it. Why don't you use it? Try not to bruise it. Buy time, don't lose it. The reflex is a lonely child. Who's waiting by the park. The reflex is a door to. Finding treasure in the dark. And watching over lucky clover. Isn't that bizarre? Every little thing the reflex does. Leaves you answered with a question mark. I'm on a ride and I want to get off. But they won't slow down the roundabout. I sold the Renoir and the TV set. Don't want to be around when this gets out. So why don't you use it? Try not to bruise it. Buy time don't lose it. Why-y-y-y-y why why why-y-y (yeah). Why-y-y-y-y why why why-y-y (yeah). Why-y-y-y-y don't you use it? The reflex is a lonely child. Who's waiting in the park. The reflex is a door to. Finding treasure in the dark. And watching over lucky clover. Isn't that bizarre? Every little thing the reflex does. Leaves me answered with a question mark. So why don't you use it? Try not to bruise it. Buy time, don't lose it. The reflex is a lonely child. Who's waiting by the park. The reflex is a door to. Finding treasure in the dark. And watching over lucky clover. Isn't that bizarre? Every little thing the reflex does. Leaves you answered with a question mark. Oh, the reflex what a game. He's hiding all the cards. The reflex is a door to. Finding treasure in the dark. And watching over lucky clover. Isn't that bizarre? Every little thing the reflex does. Leaves you answered with a question mark.
