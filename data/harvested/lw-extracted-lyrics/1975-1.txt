Love, love will keep us together. Think of me babe whenever. Some sweet talkin' girl comes along, singin' a song. Don't mess around, you just gotta be strong. Just stop, 'cause I really love you. Stop, I been thinkin' of you. Look in my heart and let love keep us together. You. you belong to me now. Ain't gonna set ya free now. When those girls start hangin' around, talkin' me down. Hear with your heart and ya won't hear a sound. Just stop. 'cause I really love you. Stop. I been thinkin' of you. Look in my heart and let love keep us together, whatever. Young and beautiful. But someday your looks'll be gone. When the others turn you off. Who'll be turnin' you on. I will, I will, I will. I will be there to share forever. Love will keep us together. I said it before and I'll say it again. While others pretend. I need ya now and I need ya then. Just stop. 'cause I really love you. Stop. I been thinkin' of you. Look in my heart and let love keep us together. Whatever. I will. , I will. , I will. , I will, ah. You better stop. cause I really love you. Stop. I been thinkin' of you. Look in my heart and let love keep us together. Whatever. I will. , I will. , I will. , I will.
