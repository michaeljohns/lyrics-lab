Darling, when you're next to me. I melt, I feel so weak. It's gettin' hard to go to sleep. With this feeling, this feeling on my mind. It needs you baby to satisfy. You can't turn me off. Not in the middle of turning me on. I can't suddenly stop. You changed me from cold to hot. Now I'm ready to give you all the love I've got. Please don't leave me now. Can't you read in my eyes. This need I have to love, love you. So don't tease me now. Please, please me now. You can't turn me off. Not in the middle of turning me on. I can't suddenly stop. Each and every time we touch. Ooh the feeling too much. Take me to that special place. You've gone too far to leave me so spaced baby. So don't tease me now. Please, please me now. You can't turn me off. Not in the middle of turning me on. I can't suddenly stop. If you love me like I love you. Then you'll do what I want you to. You'll come and hold me in your lovin' arms. And make my heart rush straight to the stars baby. You won't tease me now. You won't do nothin' but please me now. You can't turn me off. Not in the middle of turning me on.
