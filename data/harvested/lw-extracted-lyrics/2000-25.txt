Whoo. Ooh. Oh yeah yeah. Listen. Bright lights, fancy restaurants. Everything in this world that a man could want. Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow. Still I'm lonely now. Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines. From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me. Fame and fortune, still can't find. Just a grown man runnin' out of time. Even though it seems I have everything. I don't wanna be a lonely fool. All of the women. All the expensive cars. All of the money don't amount to you. So, I can make believe I have everything. But I can't pretend that I don't see. That without you girl, my life is incomplete. Said without you girl, ahh listen. Your perfume, your sexy lingerie. Girl, I remember it just like it was on yesterday. A Thursday, you told me you had fallen in love. I wasn't sure that I was. It's been a year, winter summer spring and fall. But bein' without you just ain't livin', ain't nothing at all. If I could travel back in time. I'd relive the days you were mine. Even though it seems I have everything. I don't wanna be a lonely fool. All of the women. All the expensive cars. All of the money don't amount to you. I can make believe I have everything. But I can't pretend that I don't see. That without you girl, my life is incomplete. That without you girl ahh. I just can't help lovin' you. But I loved you much too late. I'd give anything and everything. To hear you say that you'll stay. Even though it seems I have everything. I don't wanna be a lonely fool. All of the women. All the expensive cars. All of the money don't amount to you. I can make believe I have everything. But I can't pretend that I don't see. That without you girl. My life is incomplete. Even though it seems I have everything. I don't wanna be a lonely fool. All of the women. All the expensive cars. All of the money don't amount to you. I can make believe I have everything. But I can't pretend that I don't see. That without you girl. My life is incomplete. Without ya girl. Without ya girl my life. Without you girl. My life my life is incomplete. Without you girl. My life is incomplete. Oh yeah. My life is incomplete. Oh yeah yeah. Whoo.
