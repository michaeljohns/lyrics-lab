Once I thought that love was something I could never do. Never knew that I could feel this much. But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you. Is more than a reaction to your touch. It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough. The way you look, the way you laugh, The way you love with all you have, There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me. The way you kiss, The way you cry, The way you move when you walk by. There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you). That don't do something for me. In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows. That never knocked me off my feet. All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go. And baby it's no mystery why I surrender. Girl you got everything. The way you look, the way you laugh, The way you love with all you have, There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me. The way you kiss, The way you cry, The way you move when you walk by. There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you). That don't do something for me. I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought. Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on. The way you look, the way you laugh, The way you love with all you have, There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me. The way you kiss, The way you cry, The way you move when you walk by. There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you). That don't do something for me. The way you look, the way you laugh,. The way you love with all you have, Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive. The way you talk, the way you tease. Right now I think you see. There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me.
