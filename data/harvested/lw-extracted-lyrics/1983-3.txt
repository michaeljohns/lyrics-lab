First when there's nothing. But a slow glowing dream. That your fear seems to hide. Deep inside your mind. All alone, I have cried. Silent tears full of pride. In a world made of steel. Made of stone. Well, I hear the music. Close my eyes, feel the rhythm. Wrap around, take a hold of my heart. What a feeling. Being's believing. I can have it all. Now I'm dancing for my life. Take your passion. And make it happen. Pictures come alive. You can dance right through your life. Now I hear the music. Close my eyes, I am rhythm. In a flash, it takes hold of my heart. What a feeling, being's believing. I can have it all. Now I'm dancing for my life. Take your passion. And make it happen. Pictures come alive. Now I'm dancing through my life. What a feeling. What a feeling. Being's believing. Pictures come alive. You can dance right through your life. What a feeling. What a feeling. I can have it all. Have it all. I can have it all. Being's believing. Make it happen. What a feeling.
