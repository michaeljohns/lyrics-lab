Another day has gone, I’m still all alone. How could this be, you're not here with me. You never said goodbye, someone tell me why. Did you have to go and leave my world so cold. Everyday I sit and ask myself, how did love slip away. Something whispers in my ear and says. That you are not alone, I am here with you. Though you're far away, I am here to stay. You are not alone, I am here with you. Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart. You are not alone. Alone, all alone, why, alone. Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry. Asking me to come and hold you in my arms. I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear. But first I need your hand then forever can begin. Everyday I sit and ask myself, how did love slip away. Then something whispers in my ear and says. That you are not alone, I am here with you. Though you're far away, I am here to stay. You are not alone, I am here with you. Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart. You are not alone. Oh, whisper three words and I'll come runnin' (fly). And girl you know that I'll be there, I’ll be there. You are not alone, I am here with you. Though you're far away, I am here to stay. You are not alone, I am here with you. Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart. That you are not alone (You are not alone), I am here with you (I am here with you), Though you're far away (Though you're far away), (You and me) I am here to stay. You are not alone (You're always in my he-), I am here with you (-a-), Though we're far apart (-a-), you're always in my heart (-rt-). You are not alone (Not alone, oh). You are not alone, You are not alone. Said again, You are not alone, You are not alone. Not alone, not alone. Did you raise for me, girl. In the morning, in the evening. Not alone, not alone, you and me, not alone, oh. Together, together.
