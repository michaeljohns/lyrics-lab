I hear you're taking the town again. Having a good time. With all your good time friends. I don't think that you think of me. You're on your own now. And I'm alone and free. I know that I should get on with my life. But a life lived without you could never be right. As long as the stars shine down from the heavens. Long as the rivers run to the sea. I'll never get over you gettin' over me. I try to smile so the hurt won't show. Tell everybody that I was glad to see you go. But the tears just won't go away (won't go away). Lonliness found me, looks like it's here to stay. I know that I ought to find someone new. But all I find is myself always thinkin' of you. As long as the stars shine down from the heavens. Long as the rivers run to the sea. I'll never get over you gettin' over me. Oh, no matter what I do. Each night's a lifetime to live through. I can't go on like this (I need your touch). You're the only one I ever loved, oh. And as long as the stars shine down from the heavens. Long as the rivers run to the sea. I'll never get over you gettin' over me. I'll never get over you gettin' over. Never get over you. gettin over. I'll never get over you gettin' over me.
