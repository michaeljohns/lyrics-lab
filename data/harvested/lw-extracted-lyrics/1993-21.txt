They say it's a river, that circles the earth. A beam of light shining to the edge of the universe. It conquers all. It changes everything. They say it's a blessing. They say it's a gift. They say it's a miracle and I believe that it is. It conquers all. but it's a mystery. Love breaks your heart. Love takes no less than everything. Love makes it hard. And fades away so easily. In this world we've created. In this place that we live. In a blink of an eye, baby, the darkness slips in. Love lights the world, unites the lovers for eternity. Love breaks the chain. Love aches for everyone of us. Love takes the tears and the pain. And turns it in to the beauty that remains. Look at this place. It was paradise but now it's dying. I'll pray for love. I'll take my chances that it's not too late. Love breaks your heart. Love takes no less than everything. Love makes it hard. And fades away so easily. Love breaks the chain. Love aches for everyone of us. Love takes the tears and the pain. And turns it in to the beauty that remains.
